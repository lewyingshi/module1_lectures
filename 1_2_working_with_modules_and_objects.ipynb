Therefore, we do NOT keep these books\\r\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\r\\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\r\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\r\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\r\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\\r\\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\\r\\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\\r\\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\\r\\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\\r\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\r\\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\r\\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\\r\\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\\r\\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\\r\\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\\r\\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\\r\\ngirls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?  How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so\\r\\n tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\\r\\nthat he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\\r\\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\\r\\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\\r\\nmay like you the best of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly HAVE had my share of\\r\\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\\r\\nover thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\\r\\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an\\r\\nestablishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and\\r\\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for\\r\\nin general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you\\r\\nmust go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\\r\\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\\r\\n my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\ngiving HER the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied\\r\\nhe; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\nsomething more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a\\r\\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\\r\\nfor my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\\r\\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\\r\\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic\\r\\nhumour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-\\r\\ntwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand\\r\\nhis character.  HER mind was less difficult to develop.  She was\\r\\na woman of mean understanding, little information, and\\r\\nuncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied\\r\\nherself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.  It\\r\\nwas then disclosed in the following manner: --Observing his\\r\\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\\r\\naddressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\" said\\r\\nher mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet\\r\\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\\r\\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\nhave no opinion of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that\\r\\nyou do not depend on her serving you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\\r\\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!  Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she\\r\\ntimes them ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\r\\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is\\r\\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\nthe end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else\\r\\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\\r\\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if\\r\\nyou decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\\r\\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\nTHERE. What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\\r\\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make\\r\\nextracts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that\\r\\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\\r\\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\npaid the visit; we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\r\\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\nhad expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I\\r\\nshould\\r\\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\nsuch a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\\r\\nand never said a word about it till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr.\\r\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\nraptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the\\r\\ndoor was shut.  \"I do not know how you will ever make him\\r\\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\\r\\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\nacquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare\\r\\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I AM the\\r\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\nwould return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they\\r\\nshould ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\nThey attacked him in various way-- with barefaced questions,\\r\\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\\r\\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\\r\\nwith him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome,\\r\\nextremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be\\r\\nat the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more\\r\\ndelightful!  To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards\\r\\nfalling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart\\r\\nwere entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\\r\\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat\\r\\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\\r\\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\\r\\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\r\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\\r\\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\\r\\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\\r\\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\\r\\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\\r\\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\\r\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\\r\\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\\r\\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas\\r\\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\\r\\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\\r\\nsoon followed, that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\r\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\\r\\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\\r\\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\\r\\nonly six with him from London-- his five sisters and a cousin.\\r\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\\r\\nonly five altogether-- Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\\r\\nof the eldest, and another young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a\\r\\npleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His\\r\\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.  His\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but\\r\\nhis friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by\\r\\nhis fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The\\r\\ngentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\\r\\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and\\r\\nhe was looked at with great admiration for about half the\\r\\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\nhis popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above\\r\\nhis company, and above being pleased; and not all his large\\r\\nestate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to\\r\\nbe compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\\r\\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\\r\\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\\r\\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced\\r\\nto any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\\r\\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\r\\nHis character was decided.  He was the proudest, most\\r\\ndisagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\\r\\nwould never come there again.  Amongst the most violent\\r\\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\\r\\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of\\r\\ngentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\\r\\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\\r\\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\\r\\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.  I hate to see\\r\\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\\r\\nmuch better dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\\r\\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\npunishment to me to stand up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley,\\r\\n\"for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\\r\\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\\r\\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\\r\\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\\r\\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\\r\\npartner to introduce you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\\r\\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\\r\\nand coldly said:  \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\\r\\ntempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\\r\\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\\r\\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\\r\\nyour time with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\r\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her\\r\\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted\\r\\nin anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\\r\\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\\r\\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\\r\\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\\r\\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\\r\\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.  Mary had heard\\r\\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\\r\\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\\r\\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\\r\\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\\r\\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\\r\\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\\r\\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\\r\\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\\r\\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s\\r\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\\r\\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have\\r\\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\\r\\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\\r\\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\\r\\nTHAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\\r\\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\r\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\\r\\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\\r\\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\\r\\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\\r\\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\\r\\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\\r\\n Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\nsixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for ME,\" cried her husband\\r\\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!  For God\\'s\\r\\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had\\r\\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\\r\\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.  I\\r\\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.  I\\r\\ndare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\\r\\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\\r\\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\\r\\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose\\r\\nmuch by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\\r\\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\\r\\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he\\r\\nwalked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome\\r\\nenough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to\\r\\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\nsister just how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--\\r\\nso much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man\\r\\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\\r\\ncomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\\r\\nbetween us.  Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and\\r\\nME never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\\r\\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\\r\\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\\r\\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\\r\\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\\r\\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\\r\\na human being in your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\r\\nspeak what I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder.  With\\r\\nYOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\nnonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough--\\r\\none meets with it everywhere.  But to be candid without\\r\\nostentation or design-- to take the good of everybody\\'s\\r\\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--\\r\\nbelongs to you alone.  And so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do\\r\\nyou?  Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not-- at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\\r\\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\\r\\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\r\\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\\r\\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\\r\\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\\r\\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable\\r\\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\r\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune\\r\\nand their own had been acquired by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\\r\\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\\r\\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\\r\\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\\r\\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\r\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\\r\\ngeneration to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\r\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table-- nor was Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\nMr. Bingley had not been or age two years, when he was tempted\\r\\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\r\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour-- was pleased with\\r\\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\\r\\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\\r\\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\\r\\nstrength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\\r\\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\\r\\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\r\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\\r\\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\ngiving offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\\r\\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\r\\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\\r\\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\\r\\nsmiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so-- but still they\\r\\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\\r\\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\r\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\\r\\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\\r\\nhe chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\\r\\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had\\r\\nbeen formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\\r\\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\\r\\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\\r\\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to\\r\\nhis business, and to his residence in a small market town; and,\\r\\nin quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a\\r\\nhouse about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\\r\\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\\r\\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\\r\\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\\r\\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\\r\\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\\r\\nobliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\r\\ncourteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\\r\\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\\r\\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\\r\\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\\r\\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\\r\\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\ncommunicate. \"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  \"YOU\\r\\nwere Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\\r\\ntwice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her-- indeed I\\r\\nrather believe he DID-- I heard something about it-- but I\\r\\nhardly know what-- something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\r\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson\\'s asking\\r\\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\\r\\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\\r\\nand WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering\\r\\nimmediately to the last question:  \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\r\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed-- that does\\r\\nseem as if-- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS,\\r\\nEliza,\" said Charlotte.  \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth\\r\\nlistening to as his friend, is he?-- poor Eliza!-- to be only just\\r\\nTOLERABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by\\r\\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\\r\\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\\r\\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\\r\\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?-- is not there a little mistake?\"\\r\\nsaid Jane.  \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\\r\\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\\r\\nquite angry at being spoke to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\r\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With THEM he is\\r\\nremarkably agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\\r\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\\r\\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\\r\\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\\r\\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n\"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\\r\\nwith HIM, if I were you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend ME so much as\\r\\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\\r\\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\\r\\nmay so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\\r\\nforgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\\r\\nof her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\nthat I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\nthere are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\nimaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\nwords are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\\r\\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\\r\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\\r\\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.  I\\r\\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\nyour bottle directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\\r\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.  Miss Bennet\\'s\\r\\npleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\nBingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,\\r\\nand the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of\\r\\nbeing better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards\\r\\nthe two eldest.  By Jane, this attention was received with the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in\\r\\ntheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,\\r\\nand could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it\\r\\nwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence\\r\\nof their brother\\'s admiration.  It was generally evident\\r\\nwhenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was\\r\\nequally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which\\r\\nshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\r\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\\r\\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\\r\\nsince Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure\\r\\nof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would\\r\\nguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She\\r\\nmentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to\\r\\nimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her\\r\\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\nthe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark.  There is\\r\\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that\\r\\nit is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all BEGIN freely-- a\\r\\nslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\nwho have heart enough to be really in love without\\r\\nencouragement.  In nine cases out of ten a women had better\\r\\nshow MORE affection than she feels.  Bingley, likes your\\r\\nsister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if\\r\\nshe does not help him on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.  If\\r\\nI can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\r\\nindeed, not to discover it too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as\\r\\nyou do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\nconceal it, he must find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But, though\\r\\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many\\r\\nhours together; and, as they always see each other in large\\r\\nmixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\\r\\nemployed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make\\r\\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\r\\nattention.  When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure\\r\\nfor falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is\\r\\nin question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\r\\ndetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\nshould adopt it.  But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not\\r\\nacting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.  She has\\r\\nknown him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him\\r\\nat Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\\r\\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\\r\\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she\\r\\nmight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\nyou must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\r\\ntogether-- and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\nthey both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect\\r\\nto any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much\\r\\nhas been unfolded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\nand if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she\\r\\nhad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying\\r\\nhis character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is\\r\\nentirely  a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are\\r\\never so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,\\r\\nit does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always\\r\\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their\\r\\nshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of\\r\\nthe defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know\\r\\nit is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister,\\r\\nElizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\nan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\nher without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\nlooked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it\\r\\nclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature\\r\\nin her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly\\r\\nintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this\\r\\ndiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he\\r\\nhad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect\\r\\nsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure\\r\\nto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her\\r\\nmanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught\\r\\nby their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to\\r\\nher he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,\\r\\nand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\nconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\nothers.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William\\r\\nLucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\\r\\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\nsee what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not\\r\\nbegin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\\r\\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\\r\\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately\\r\\nprovoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\\r\\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster\\r\\nto give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\r\\nenergetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.  \"I\\r\\nam going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\\r\\nfollows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- always\\r\\nwanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!  If\\r\\nmy vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been\\r\\ninvaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before\\r\\nthose who must be in the habit of hearing the very best\\r\\nperformers.\"  On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added,\\r\\n\"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"  And gravely glancing at Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\r\\ncourse familiar with:  \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\';\\r\\nand I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\r\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties\\r\\nof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded\\r\\nat the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence\\r\\nof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for\\r\\nknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\\r\\ndisplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\nconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\nexcellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\nhad been listened to with much more pleasure, though not\\r\\nplaying half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto,\\r\\nwas glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\\r\\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the\\r\\nLucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at\\r\\none end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode\\r\\nof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\nwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as\\r\\none of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\namongst the less polished societies of the world.  Every savage\\r\\ncan dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William only smiled.  \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\r\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I\\r\\ndoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\nsight.  Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-- for I am\\r\\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the\\r\\nair of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\ndisposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\ntowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\r\\ngallant thing, and called out to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?  Mr. Darcy, you\\r\\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very\\r\\ndesirable partner.  You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when\\r\\nso much beauty is before you.\"  And, taking her hand, he would\\r\\nhave given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised,\\r\\nwas not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,\\r\\nand said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.  I entreat\\r\\nyou not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a\\r\\npartner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\nhonour of her hand, but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\ndid Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\npersuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\ndeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\ndislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I\\r\\nam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance-- for who would\\r\\nobject to such a partner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had\\r\\nnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her\\r\\nwith some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass\\r\\nmany evenings in this manner-- in such society; and indeed I am\\r\\nquite of you opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity,\\r\\nand yet the noise-- the nothingness, and yet the self-importance\\r\\nof all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was\\r\\nmore agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very\\r\\ngreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty\\r\\nwoman can bestow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, a desired he\\r\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\nreflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley.  \"I am all\\r\\nastonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite?-- and\\r\\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.  A\\r\\nlady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\nlove, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would\\r\\nbe wishing me joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\r\\nabsolutely settled.  You will be having a charming\\r\\nmother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at\\r\\nPemberley with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\r\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\nher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\ntwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\nentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their\\r\\nmother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could\\r\\nbut ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an\\r\\nattorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\nto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\nsettled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a\\r\\nmost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\ntempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\ntheir aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.  The two\\r\\nyoungest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\nfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\ntheir sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and\\r\\nfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\r\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\r\\nsome from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well\\r\\nsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of\\r\\na militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the\\r\\nwhole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\r\\ninteresting intelligence.  Every day added something to their\\r\\nknowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.  Their\\r\\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to\\r\\nknow the officers themselves.  Mr. Phillips visited them all, and\\r\\nthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\r\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large\\r\\nfortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,\\r\\nwas worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\r\\nan ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\r\\nBennet coolly observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\nbe two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it\\r\\nsome time, but I am now convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,\\r\\nwith perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\nCaptain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\nday, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should\\r\\nbe so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think\\r\\nslightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\nhowever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\nagree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\nparticular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have\\r\\nthe sense of their father and mother.  When they get to our age, I\\r\\ndare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--\\r\\nand, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young\\r\\ncolonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my\\r\\ngirls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster\\r\\nlooked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his\\r\\nregimentals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did\\r\\nwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\nClarke\\'s library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\\r\\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,\\r\\nand the servant waited for an answer.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while\\r\\nher daughter read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from?  What is it about?  What does he\\r\\nsay?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\r\\n     \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with\\r\\nLouisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for\\r\\nthe rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two\\r\\nwomen can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you\\r\\ncan on receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine\\r\\nwith the officers.-- Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             \"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia.  \"I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\nus of THAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were\\r\\nsure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to\\r\\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s\\r\\npurpose will be answered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that\\r\\nthe horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\nhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\ncheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;\\r\\nJane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters\\r\\nwere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain\\r\\ncontinued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly\\r\\ncould not some back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more\\r\\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.  Till\\r\\nthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity\\r\\nof her contrivance.  Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant\\r\\nfrom Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\r\\n     \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I\\r\\nsuppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\r\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\r\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones-- therefore do not be\\r\\nalarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- and,\\r\\nexcepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\r\\nmatter with me.-- Yours, etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\nnote aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\nillness-- if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\nwas all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little\\r\\ntrifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long as she\\r\\nstays there, it is all very well.  I would go an see her if I could\\r\\nhave the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such\\r\\na thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you\\r\\nget there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane-- which is all I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\nnothing when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back\\r\\nby dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but\\r\\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\nopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\r\\nLydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\nladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps\\r\\nwe may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the\\r\\nlodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued\\r\\nher walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping\\r\\nover stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity,\\r\\nand finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\nankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\nexercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane\\r\\nwere assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal\\r\\nof surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in\\r\\nthe day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost\\r\\nincredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nconvinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was\\r\\nreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s\\r\\nmanners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\ngood humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\r\\nHurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between\\r\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her\\r\\ncomplexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming\\r\\nso far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\nnot well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be\\r\\ntaken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld\\r\\nby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in\\r\\nher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at\\r\\nher entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much\\r\\nconversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\nattempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\r\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently\\r\\nattended her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\nElizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\naffection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary\\r\\ncame, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\nsupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\nendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\nand promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed\\r\\nreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached\\r\\nacutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\r\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,\\r\\nin fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\nvery unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\nand she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\ntestified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\nobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\nremain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\nconsented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to\\r\\nacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\nsix Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries\\r\\nwhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure\\r\\nof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nshe could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no\\r\\nmeans better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\ntimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have\\r\\na bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\nthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\r\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\\r\\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\ncould regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\nevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\nprevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\\r\\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little\\r\\nnotice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom\\r\\nElizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat,\\r\\ndrink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a\\r\\nplain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\nBingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\r\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture\\r\\nof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no\\r\\nbeauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\nexcellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\nmorning.  She really looked almost wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!  Why must SHE be scampering\\r\\nabout the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so\\r\\nuntidy, so blowsy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had\\r\\nbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but\\r\\nthis was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\r\\nlooked remarkably well when she came into the room this\\r\\nmorning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see\\r\\nYOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it\\r\\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could\\r\\nshe mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of\\r\\nconceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\ndecorum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\r\\nBingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\\r\\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\\r\\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\r\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\nvery sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\nsettled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\\r\\nMeryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\\r\\nCheapside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\nheartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\\r\\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\nof any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\ntheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the\\r\\nexpense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her\\r\\nroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\\r\\nsummoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had\\r\\nthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather\\r\\nright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On\\r\\nentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and\\r\\nwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\nplaying high, she declined it, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\\r\\nsingular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a\\r\\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\"said\\r\\nBingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\\r\\nthe table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered\\r\\nto fetch her others-- all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my\\r\\nown credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many,\\r\\nI have more than I ever looked into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\nthose in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should\\r\\nhave left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\nyou have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\r\\ngenerations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\\r\\nalways buying books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\nas these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\nbeauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build YOUR\\r\\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There\\r\\nis not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\r\\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside,\\r\\nshe drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\r\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s\\r\\nheight, or rather taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\ndelighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners!  And\\r\\nso extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte is exquisite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have\\r\\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\nand net purses.  I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\r\\nand I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\ntime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a\\r\\nwoman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or\\r\\ncovering a screen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in\\r\\nyour estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing\\r\\nmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,\\r\\nthat are really accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal\\r\\nin your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\nusually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\ndeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain\\r\\nsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\nhalf-deserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she\\r\\nmust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\nher mind by extensive reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\\r\\naccomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing\\r\\nANY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\\r\\npossibility of all this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw such a woman.  I never saw such capacity, and\\r\\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\nmany women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst\\r\\ncalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention\\r\\nto what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at\\r\\nan end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was\\r\\nclosed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to\\r\\nrecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\\r\\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my\\r\\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\naddressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies\\r\\nsometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever\\r\\nbears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\ncontinue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\nworse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.\\r\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced\\r\\nthat no country advice could be of any service, recommended an\\r\\nexpress to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This\\r\\nshe would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply\\r\\nwith their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\nshould be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not\\r\\ndecidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\r\\ndeclared that they were miserable:  They solaced their\\r\\nwretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could\\r\\nfind no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper\\r\\ndirections that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and\\r\\nin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\nanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\nelegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this\\r\\namendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\nLongbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\njudgement of her situation.  The note was immediately\\r\\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached\\r\\nNetherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\\r\\nhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that\\r\\nher illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\nimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\nher from Netherfield.  She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\napothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\nadvisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\ndaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met\\r\\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\nworse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill\\r\\nto be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley.  \"It must not be thought of.  My\\r\\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon it, madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\ncivility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\r\\nwhile she remains with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\nand suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\nworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\nexception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.  I often tell\\r\\nmy other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room\\r\\nhere, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel\\r\\nwalk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\nNetherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,\\r\\nthough you have but a short lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\r\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\nfive minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\nfixed here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- I understand you perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\nseen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is as it happens.  It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not\\r\\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that\\r\\nyour were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.  They\\r\\nhave at least that advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few\\r\\nsubjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move\\r\\nin a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something\\r\\nnew to be observed in them for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\nmentioning a country neighbourhood.  \"I assure you there is\\r\\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\nmoment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she\\r\\nhad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places.  The\\r\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\r\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.  They have\\r\\neach their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that\\r\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\nher mother.  \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that\\r\\nthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\ncountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\nare few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with\\r\\nfour-and-twenty families.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\nhis countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\neyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nfor the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s\\r\\nthoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at\\r\\nLongbourn since HER coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable\\r\\nman Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?  So much the man of\\r\\nfashion!  So genteel and easy!  He had always something to say\\r\\nto everybody.  THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those\\r\\npersons who fancy themselves very important, and never open\\r\\ntheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about\\r\\nmince-pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\\r\\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very\\r\\ndifferently.  But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\nLucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity\\r\\nthey are not handsome!  Not that I think Charlotte so VERY\\r\\nplain-- but then she is our particular friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.  I do not\\r\\nlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-- one does\\r\\nnot often see anybody better looking.  It is what everybody says.\\r\\nI do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,\\r\\nthere was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in\\r\\nlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her\\r\\nan offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not.\\r\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some\\r\\nverses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There\\r\\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.  I\\r\\nwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving\\r\\naway love!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\" said\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of  a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Everything nourishes\\r\\nwhat is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\nentirely away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\nagain.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\nand after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\ntroubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly\\r\\ncivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\nand say what the occasion required.  She performed her part\\r\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this\\r\\nsignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The\\r\\ntwo girls had been whispering to each other during the whole\\r\\nvisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\r\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\ncountry to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with\\r\\nher mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an\\r\\nearly age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\nself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\r\\nher uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\nher, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,\\r\\ntherefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\r\\nabruptly reminded him that it would be the most shameful thing\\r\\nin the world if he did not keep it.  His answer to this sudden\\r\\nattack was delightful to her mother\\'s ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\nvery day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing\\r\\nwhen she is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.  \"Oh! yes-- it would be much\\r\\nbetter to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\nCaptain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have\\r\\ngiven YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\nalso.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\ndoes not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughter then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\nreturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\'\\r\\nbehaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\nlatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\ntheir censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on\\r\\nFINE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\\r\\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\nletter and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his\\r\\nsister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\\r\\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\\r\\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\\r\\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\\r\\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\\r\\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\\r\\nunion with her opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\\r\\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\\r\\nthink them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I\\r\\nmend pens remarkably well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you-- but I always mend my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\\r\\nsuperior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\r\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  It is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\\r\\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\\r\\nfor me to determine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\nwith ease, cannot write ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried\\r\\nher brother, \"because he does not write with ease.  He studies\\r\\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--\\r\\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to\\r\\nmy correspondents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm\\r\\nreproof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\r\\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\nan indirect boast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of\\r\\nmodesty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\\r\\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\\r\\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\r\\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that\\r\\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\\r\\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\ncompliment to yourself-- and yet what is there so very laudable\\r\\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\r\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\\r\\nelse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And, yet, upon\\r\\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\nbelieve it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\nthe ladies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\\r\\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\\r\\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  \\'Bingley,\\r\\nyou had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it,\\r\\nyou would probably not go-- and at another word, might stay a\\r\\nmonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\r\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\\r\\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting\\r\\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\\r\\nspeak for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\\r\\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\\r\\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\\r\\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\\r\\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\\r\\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\\r\\nfavour of its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield readily-- easily-- to the PERSUASION of a friend is\\r\\nno merit with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\nunderstanding of either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\\r\\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\\r\\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\\r\\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\\r\\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\\r\\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\r\\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\\r\\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\\r\\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\\r\\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\\r\\nargued into it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\\r\\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\r\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have\\r\\nmore weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\nfellow, in comparison with myself, that I should not pay him half\\r\\nso much deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\\r\\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\\r\\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\\r\\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.  \"You dislike an\\r\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you\\r\\nand Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\\r\\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\\r\\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\\r\\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\\r\\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how\\r\\nfrequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew\\r\\nhow to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so\\r\\ngreat a man; and yet that he should look at her because he\\r\\ndisliked her, was still more strange.  She could only imagine,\\r\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was\\r\\nsomething more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas\\r\\nof right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did\\r\\nnot pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\\r\\nsome surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\r\\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\ncheating a person of their meditated contempt.  I have,\\r\\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\ndance a reel at all-- and now despise me if you dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\\r\\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority\\r\\nof her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\nsuch an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\\r\\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\\r\\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\npossesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips get\\r\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\\r\\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\\r\\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you\\r\\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\r\\nbeautiful eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\r\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\\r\\nbe copied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley,\\r\\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You used us abominably ill, \"answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running\\r\\naway without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\\r\\ninto the avenue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\nthem, laughingly answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\\r\\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the\\r\\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\\r\\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\nhours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\nthe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends\\r\\nwith many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen\\r\\nthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed\\r\\nbefore the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation\\r\\nwere considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with\\r\\naccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\nobject; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\nand she had something to say to him before he had advanced\\r\\nmany steps.  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\ncongratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said\\r\\nhe was \"very glad\"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\nBingley\\'s salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first\\r\\nhalf-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\nfrom the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\nother side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\ndoor.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\nelse.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\ngreat delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\ncard-table-- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\neven his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one\\r\\nintended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\nsubject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\ndo, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\r\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with\\r\\nMiss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s progress through HIS book, as in reading her own;\\r\\nand she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking\\r\\nat his page.  She could not win him, however, to any\\r\\nconversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At\\r\\nlength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her\\r\\nown book, which she had only chosen because it was the second\\r\\nvolume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\r\\nis to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no\\r\\nenjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of anything\\r\\nthan of a book!  When I have a house of my own, I shall be\\r\\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\namusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\nBennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\\r\\nat Netherfield?  I would advise you, before you determine on it,\\r\\nto consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if\\r\\nthere are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a\\r\\npunishment than a pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\r\\nchooses, before it begins-- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\r\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I\\r\\nshall send round my cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\r\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It\\r\\nwould surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\ndancing were made the order of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\nnot be near so much like a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up\\r\\nand walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she\\r\\nwalked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still\\r\\ninflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings, she\\r\\nresolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\\r\\nand take a turn about the room.  I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\nafter sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss\\r\\nBingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\nDarcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of\\r\\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\\r\\nunconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join\\r\\ntheir party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine\\r\\nbut two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\\r\\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\\r\\nwould interfere.  \"What could he mean?  She was dying to know\\r\\nwhat could be his meaning?\"-- and asked Elizabeth whether she\\r\\ncould at all understand him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to\\r\\nbe severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be\\r\\nto ask nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\r\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an\\r\\nexplanation of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he,\\r\\nas soon as she allowed him to speak.  \"You either choose this\\r\\nmethod of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s\\r\\nconfidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are\\r\\nconscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in\\r\\nwalking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if\\r\\nthe second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley.  \"I never heard anything so\\r\\nabominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease him-- laugh\\r\\nat him.  Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT.  I do assure you that my\\r\\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT.  Tease calmness of\\r\\nmanner and presence of mind!  No, no-- feel he may defy us\\r\\nthere.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\\r\\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject.  Mr. Darcy may\\r\\nhug himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"That is an\\r\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,\\r\\nfor it would be a great loss to ME to have many such\\r\\nacquaintances.  I dearly love a laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\nThe wisest and the best of men-- nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\nactions-- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first\\r\\nobject in life is a joke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth-- \"there are such people, but I\\r\\nhope I am not one of THEM.  I hope I never ridicule what is\\r\\nwise and good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and\\r\\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them\\r\\nwhenever I can.  But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\\r\\nare without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.  But it has been the\\r\\nstudy of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\nstrong understanding to ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride-- where there is a\\r\\nreal superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\nregulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.\\r\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.  I have\\r\\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My\\r\\ntemper I dare not vouch for.  It is, I believe, too little yielding--\\r\\ncertainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot\\r\\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their\\r\\noffenses against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with\\r\\nevery attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be\\r\\ncalled resentful.  My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\\r\\nresentment IS a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your\\r\\nfault well.  I really cannot LAUGH at it.  You are safe from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\nparticular evil-- a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\neducation can overcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours, \"he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\\r\\nmisunderstand them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\nconversation in which she had no share.  \"Louisa, you will not\\r\\nmind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not\\r\\nsorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\nmuch attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\nmight be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at\\r\\nNetherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly\\r\\nfinish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with\\r\\npleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\r\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get\\r\\nhome.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\\r\\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was\\r\\nadded, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay\\r\\nlonger, she could spare them very well.  Against staying longer,\\r\\nhowever, Elizabeth was positively resolved-- nor did she much\\r\\nexpect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being\\r\\nconsidered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged\\r\\nJane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\r\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving\\r\\nNetherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and\\r\\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the\\r\\nfollowing day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going\\r\\nwas deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\\r\\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\\r\\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were\\r\\nto go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that\\r\\nit would not be safe for her-- that she was not enough recovered;\\r\\nbut Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence-- Elizabeth had been\\r\\nat Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he\\r\\nliked-- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing\\r\\nthan usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly\\r\\ncareful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him,\\r\\nnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his\\r\\nfelicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his\\r\\nbehaviour during the last day must have material weight in\\r\\nconfirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely\\r\\nspoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and\\r\\nthough they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour,\\r\\nhe adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not\\r\\neven look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable\\r\\nto almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\nincreased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;\\r\\nand when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it\\r\\nwould always give her to see her either at Longbourn or\\r\\nNetherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\nhands with the former.  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party\\r\\nin the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very\\r\\nwrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have\\r\\ncaught cold again.  But their father, though very laconic in his\\r\\nexpressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt\\r\\ntheir importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation,\\r\\nwhen they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,\\r\\nand almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass\\r\\nand human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some\\r\\nnew observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine\\r\\nand Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much\\r\\nhad been done and much had been said in the regiment since the\\r\\npreceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately\\r\\nwith their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually\\r\\nbeen hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good\\r\\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our\\r\\nfamily party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\\r\\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in-- And\\r\\nI hope MY dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\\r\\nshe often sees such at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.  \"A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\\r\\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But--good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\\r\\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell-- I\\r\\nmust speak to Hill this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom\\r\\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\nexplained:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\r\\npleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\\r\\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\\r\\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\\r\\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\r\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\\r\\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling and estate\\r\\naway from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom\\r\\nnobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\\r\\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\\r\\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\\r\\nhis father did before him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\nthat head, as you will hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\r\\n                                                   \"15th October.\\r\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\r\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\\r\\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to\\r\\nheal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\\r\\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for\\r\\nme to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\\r\\npleased him to be at variance,--  \\'There, Mrs. Bennet.\\'-- My\\r\\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\\r\\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\\r\\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\\r\\nmyself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever\\r\\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\\r\\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\\r\\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\\r\\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\\r\\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\\r\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\r\\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.  I\\r\\ncannot otherwise than be concerned at being the means of\\r\\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\r\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\\r\\npossible amends-- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no\\r\\nobjection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the\\r\\nsatisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\r\\nNovember 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on\\r\\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I\\r\\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\\r\\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\\r\\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.-- I\\r\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\r\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n                                   \"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\ngentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  \"He\\r\\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\\r\\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\ncome to us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\nperson to discourage him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can\\r\\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\ncertainly to his credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.  \"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.  There is something very pompous in his style.  And what\\r\\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?  We\\r\\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.  Could he be a\\r\\nsensible man, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\nquite the reverse.  Thee is a mixture of servility and\\r\\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\\r\\nimpatient to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\nany degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\\r\\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\\r\\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\\r\\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter\\r\\nhad done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see\\r\\nhim with a degree of composure which astonished her husband\\r\\nand daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\\r\\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\\r\\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\\r\\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\\r\\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\nwere very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\ncomplimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\r\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\\r\\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that\\r\\nhe did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in\\r\\nmarriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of\\r\\nhis hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\\r\\ncompliments, answered most readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\\r\\nsettled so oddly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\r\\nmust confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such\\r\\nthings I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing\\r\\nhow estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\\r\\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\\r\\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\non each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin\\'s\\r\\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were\\r\\nexamined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.  The\\r\\ndinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\\r\\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\\r\\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\\r\\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\\r\\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\\r\\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\\r\\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\nservants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\nconversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\\r\\nvery fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s\\r\\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\\r\\nappeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject\\r\\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a\\r\\nmost important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life\\r\\nwitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank-- such affability\\r\\nand condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both\\r\\nof the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at\\r\\nRosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make\\r\\nup her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was\\r\\nreckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never\\r\\nseen anything but affability in her.  She had always spoken to\\r\\nhim as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\nsmallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\nweek or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended\\r\\nto advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose\\r\\nwith discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\nparsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\nhe had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\nherself-- some shelves in the closet upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It is a pity that\\r\\ngreat ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\\r\\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  Has she any family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off\\r\\nthan many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  Is she\\r\\nhandsome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine\\r\\nherself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\nsuperior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\nher features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented\\r\\nher from making that progress in many accomplishments which\\r\\nshe could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the\\r\\nlady who superintended her education, and who still resides with\\r\\nthem.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\ndrive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among\\r\\nthe ladies at court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\ndeprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.  Her\\r\\nladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that\\r\\nI am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\ncompliments which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have more\\r\\nthan once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming\\r\\ndaughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be\\r\\nadorned by her.  These are the kind of little things which please\\r\\nher ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself\\r\\npeculiarly bound to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for\\r\\nyou that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I\\r\\nask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\nof the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\nI sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\nlittle elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\noccasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was\\r\\nas absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\\r\\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most\\r\\nresolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional\\r\\nglance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\r\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again,\\r\\nand, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the\\r\\nladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;\\r\\nbut, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\ncirculating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\nprotested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\nLydia exclaimed.  Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.  Lydia gaped as he\\r\\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous\\r\\nsolemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\\r\\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My\\r\\naunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton\\r\\nto-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny\\r\\ncomes back from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\nMr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\r\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so\\r\\nadvantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer\\r\\nimportune my young cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\nat backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing\\r\\nthat he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\namusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most\\r\\ncivilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not\\r\\noccur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\nassuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\nshould never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\nat another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for\\r\\nbackgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest\\r\\npart of his life having been spent under the guidance of an\\r\\nilliterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of\\r\\nthe universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without\\r\\nforming at it any useful acquaintance.  The subjection in which\\r\\nhis father had brought him up had given him originally great\\r\\nhumility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by\\r\\nthe self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\nconsequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A\\r\\nfortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\\r\\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\npatroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\nauthority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\naltogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,\\r\\nself-importance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\\r\\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\\r\\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose\\r\\none of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable\\r\\nas they were represented by common report.  This was his plan\\r\\noff amends-- of atonement-- for inheriting their father\\'s estate;\\r\\nand he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his\\r\\nown part.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.  Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\nwhat was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his\\r\\nsettled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration;\\r\\nfor in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before\\r\\nbreakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,\\r\\nand leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress\\r\\nmight be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid\\r\\nvery complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution\\r\\nagainst the very Jane he had fixed on.  \"As to her YOUNGER\\r\\ndaughters, she could not take upon her to say-- she could not\\r\\npositively answer-- but she did not KNOW of any prepossession;\\r\\nher ELDEST daughter, she must just mention-- she felt it\\r\\nincumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-- and it\\r\\nwas soon done-- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\nher of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\nsoon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could\\r\\nnot bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good\\r\\ngraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;\\r\\nevery sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most\\r\\nanxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for\\r\\nthither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he\\r\\nwould continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios\\r\\nin the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\ncessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.  Such doings\\r\\ndiscomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\nhe told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\nroom of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\njoin his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\nmuch better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\npleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The\\r\\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\nhim.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\nquest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\nindeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\nway.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose\\r\\nreturn from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as\\r\\nthey passed.  All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all\\r\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\r\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense\\r\\nof wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had\\r\\njust gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back,\\r\\nhad reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\\r\\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nwho had returned with him the day before from town, and he\\r\\nwas happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\nregimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance\\r\\nwas greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a\\r\\nfine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The\\r\\nintroduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of\\r\\nconversation-- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking\\r\\ntogether very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their\\r\\nnotice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen\\r\\ncame directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\r\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\r\\nprincipal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn\\r\\non purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with\\r\\na bow, an was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on\\r\\nElizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of\\r\\nboth as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\\r\\neffect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white,\\r\\nthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his\\r\\nhat-- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What\\r\\ncould be the meaning of it?  It was impossible to imagine; it was\\r\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\nnoticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to\\r\\nthe door of Mr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in\\r\\nspite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come\\r\\nin, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour\\r\\nwindow and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\neldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\nshe was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\nhome, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\nshould have known nothing about, if she had not happened to\\r\\nsee Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that\\r\\nthey were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\nthe Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was\\r\\nclaimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.  She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned\\r\\nwith as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any\\r\\nprevious acquaintance with her, which he could not help\\r\\nflattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\nto the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but\\r\\nher contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\nexclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,\\r\\nshe could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\r\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching\\r\\nhim the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\nand had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\\r\\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed\\r\\nwindows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison\\r\\nwith the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\r\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and\\r\\ntheir aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nand give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy\\r\\ngame of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\r\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted\\r\\nin mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in\\r\\nquitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that\\r\\nthey were perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had\\r\\nseen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would\\r\\nhave defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the\\r\\nwrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\nadmiring Mrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness.  He protested\\r\\nthat, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen\\r\\na more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with\\r\\nthe utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\ninvitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\nbefore.  Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\nconnection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\nattention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement\\r\\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\na suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nhad accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\\r\\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\\r\\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\\r\\nwho was its proprietor-- when she had listened to the description\\r\\nof only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that\\r\\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\\r\\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\\r\\na comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\nconsequence increased with what she heard, and who was\\r\\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\\r\\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and\\r\\nwho had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\\r\\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\\r\\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\\r\\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\\r\\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\\r\\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of\\r\\nthe ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set,\\r\\nand the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\r\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\\r\\nand walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\\r\\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\\r\\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\\r\\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\\r\\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\\r\\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\\r\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\\r\\nthe skill of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be\\r\\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\\r\\nthere seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\nwas a most determined talked; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\\r\\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\nleisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold-- the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\\r\\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\\r\\nunexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\\r\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\\r\\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\r\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\nsubject drop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in\\r\\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.  A\\r\\nclear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\\r\\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\nparticular manner from my infancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.  \"I\\r\\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\nvery disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his\\r\\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\\r\\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\\r\\nimpossible for ME to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of\\r\\nhim would in general astonish-- and perhaps you would not\\r\\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\\r\\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\\r\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\nbeyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\\r\\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\\r\\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\\r\\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n ill-tempered man.\"  Wickham shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away\\r\\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no-- it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\\r\\nHE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go.  We are not on\\r\\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\nhave no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\\r\\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\ndisgracing  the memory of his father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\\r\\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he\\r\\nadded, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I\\r\\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\nDenny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\nquarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\\r\\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\nwill not bear solitude.  I MUST have employment and society.\\r\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\nhave now made it eligible.  The church OUGHT to have been\\r\\nmy profession-- I was brought up for the church, and I should at\\r\\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\\r\\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\\r\\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\\r\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\\r\\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT be?\\r\\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\\r\\nredress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not\\r\\nhave doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it-- or\\r\\nto treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\nthat I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--\\r\\nin short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\\r\\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\\r\\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I\\r\\ncannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\\r\\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\\r\\nspoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely.  I can recall\\r\\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of\\r\\nmen, and that he hates me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some time or other he WILL be-- but it shall not be by ME.\\r\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\r\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me-- a dislike which I cannot\\r\\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\\r\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\\r\\nbut his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\\r\\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\ncompetition in which we stood-- the sort of preference which\\r\\nwas often given me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this-- though I have\\r\\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\\r\\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\\r\\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\\r\\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I DO\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\ncan hardly be just to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n\"to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of\\r\\nhis father!\"  She could have added, \"a young man, too, like\\r\\nYOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\namiable\"-- but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who\\r\\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\\r\\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\nparental care.  MY father began life in the profession which your\\r\\nuncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to-- but he\\r\\ngave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\\r\\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He\\r\\nwas most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\\r\\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\\r\\nunder the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active\\r\\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s\\r\\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\\r\\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\\r\\ngratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"How abominable!  I wonder\\r\\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\\r\\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\\r\\nproud to be dishonest-- for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions\\r\\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\\r\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\\r\\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and FILIAL pride-- for he is very\\r\\nproud of what his father was-- have done this.  Not to appear to\\r\\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\\r\\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\r\\nHe has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly\\r\\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\\r\\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\\r\\nattentive and best of brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.  \"I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me\\r\\npain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\\r\\nbrother-- very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\npleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\\r\\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\\r\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\\r\\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\\r\\nsuperintends her education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\\r\\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\\r\\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\\r\\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\nperhaps agreeable-- allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\\r\\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\\r\\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\\r\\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\\r\\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\\r\\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\\r\\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\\r\\nwould not make herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down\\r\\nto a card table, they must take their chances of these things, and\\r\\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\\r\\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\\r\\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\\r\\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr,.\\r\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\nfamily of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given\\r\\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\\r\\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\\r\\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\\r\\npresent Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\nestates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he\\r\\nwere already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\\r\\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\\r\\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\\r\\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\nevery one connected with him should have an understanding of\\r\\nthe first class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\\r\\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till\\r\\nsupper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their\\r\\nshare of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions.  There could be no\\r\\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his\\r\\nmanners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\\r\\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\\r\\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\\r\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost\\r\\nand the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\\r\\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the\\r\\nleast regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at\\r\\nsupper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had\\r\\nmore to say than he could well manage before the carriage\\r\\nstopped at Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\nMr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\nconcern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be\\r\\nso unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\nnature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\nappearance as Wickham.  The possibility of his having endured\\r\\nsuch unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;\\r\\nand nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of\\r\\nthem both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the\\r\\naccount of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people\\r\\nhave perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short,\\r\\nimpossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances\\r\\nwhich may have alienated them, without actual blame on either\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got\\r\\nto say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\nconcerned in the business?  Do clear THEM too, or we shall be\\r\\nobliged to think ill of somebody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\\r\\nmy opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a\\r\\ndisgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s\\r\\nfavourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to\\r\\nprovide for.  It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no\\r\\nman who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\r\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\r\\nOh! no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on,\\r\\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\nhe gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned\\r\\nwithout ceremony.  If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\\r\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult indeed-- it is distressing.  One does not know what\\r\\nto think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-- that Mr.\\r\\nBingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\nwhen the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery,\\r\\nwhere this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\\r\\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the\\r\\nlong-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the\\r\\nfollowing Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\r\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\\r\\ntheir separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little\\r\\nattention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not\\r\\nmuch to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were\\r\\nsoon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\ntook their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to\\r\\nescape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\nevery female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\ngiven in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\nflattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\ninstead of a ceremonious card.  Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\nevening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\nher brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\ngreat deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\neverything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look and behavior.  The happiness\\r\\nanticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\nevent, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\nElizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was be no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\\r\\na ball was, at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her\\r\\nfamily that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\\r\\nenough-- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\nengagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\none of hose who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\nas desirable for everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\\r\\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not\\r\\nhelp asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s\\r\\ninvitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join\\r\\nin the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find\\r\\nthat he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was\\r\\nvery far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a\\r\\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\nrespectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\nfrom objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\nthe evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss\\r\\nElizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which\\r\\nI trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\nany disrespect for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully\\r\\nproposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances;\\r\\nand to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been\\r\\nworse times.  There was no help for it, however.  Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little\\r\\nlonger, and Mr. Collins\\' proposal accepted with as good a grace\\r\\nas she could.  She was not better the pleased with his gallantry\\r\\nfrom the idea it suggested of something more.  It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as\\r\\nworthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of\\r\\nassisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of\\r\\nmore eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as\\r\\nshe observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard\\r\\nhis frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\nthough more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of\\r\\nher charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\\r\\nagreeable to HER.  Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take\\r\\nthe hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the\\r\\noffer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\nof, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\nstate at this time, for form the day of the invitation, to the day of\\r\\nthe ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their\\r\\nwalking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could\\r\\nbe sought after-- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by\\r\\nproxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\npatience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\nher acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\ndance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\\r\\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\nlooked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\nthere assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\nto her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by\\r\\nany of those recollections that might not unreasonably have\\r\\nalarmed her.  She had dressed with more than usual care, and\\r\\nprepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that\\r\\nremained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more\\r\\nthan might be won in the course of the evening.  But in an\\r\\ninstant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely\\r\\nomitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the\\r\\nofficers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute\\r\\nfact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to\\r\\nwhom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham\\r\\nhad been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and\\r\\nwas not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not\\r\\nimagine his business would have called him away just now, if he\\r\\nhad not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\nless answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\nhad been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\nwas so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\nhardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which\\r\\nhe directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance,\\r\\nforbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\\r\\nturned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not\\r\\nwholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\\r\\npartiality provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\ndwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was\\r\\nsoon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\ncousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The first\\r\\ntwo dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\ndances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\r\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery\\r\\nwhich disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.  The\\r\\nmoment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\ntalking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,\\r\\nand was in conversation with her, when she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by\\r\\nsurprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\nwhat she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of\\r\\npresence of mind;  Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid!  THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\nTo find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate!  Do not\\r\\nwish me such an evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\\r\\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help\\r\\ncautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her\\r\\nfancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of\\r\\na man ten times his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\nand took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she\\r\\nwas arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nand reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in\\r\\nbeholding it.  They stood for some time without speaking a\\r\\nword; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last\\r\\nthrough the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it;\\r\\ntill suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to\\r\\nher partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\nobservation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.\\r\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:-- \"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\ntalked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of\\r\\nremark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\nshould be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  That reply will do for the present.  Perhaps by and\\r\\nby I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than\\r\\npublic ones.  But NOW we may be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look\\r\\nodd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\nadvantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\nthat they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.  We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down\\r\\nto posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I\\r\\nam sure,\" said he.  \"How near it may be to MINE, I cannot\\r\\npretend to say.  YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\nvery often walk to Meryton?  She answered in the affirmative,\\r\\nand, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us\\r\\nthere the other day, we had just been forming a new\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur\\r\\noverspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth,\\r\\nthough blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\r\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\r\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\r\\nMAKING friends-- whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\nRETAINING them, is less certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\nsuffer from all his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\nsubject.  At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\nthem, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\nroom; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\nsuperior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\npartner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.  Such\\r\\nvery superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you\\r\\nbelong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your\\r\\nfair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have\\r\\nthis pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\nevent, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\ntake place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to\\r\\nMr. Darcy:-- but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not\\r\\nthank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\nSir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,\\r\\nand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression\\r\\ntowards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\nand said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what\\r\\nwe were talking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not\\r\\nhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\nthemselves.  We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Books-- oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with\\r\\nthe same feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\nleast be no want of subject.  We may compare our different\\r\\nopinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always\\r\\nfull of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes-- does it?\"\\r\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\nher thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember\\r\\nhearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\nthat you resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are\\r\\nvery cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\nopinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\\r\\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity.  \"I am trying to make it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.  \"I do not get on at all.  I hear such\\r\\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may\\r\\nvary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthat you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\nas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\ncredit on either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\\r\\nanother opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly\\r\\nreplied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance\\r\\nand parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\nan equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable\\r\\npowerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon,\\r\\nand directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards\\r\\nher, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:-- \"So,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\nWickham!  Your sister has been talking to me about him, and\\r\\nasking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\\r\\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he\\r\\nwas the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward.  Let\\r\\nme recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\nconfidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him\\r\\nill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the\\r\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\nleast to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\nmentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\nnot well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\nway.  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\nindeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\nsame,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\nof nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward,\\r\\nand of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\nsneer.  \"Excuse my interference: it was kindly meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.  \"You are much\\r\\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\\r\\nas this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\nmalice of Mr. Darcy.\"  She then sought her eldest sister, who\\r\\nhas undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\r\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of\\r\\nsuch happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\nsatisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  Elizabeth instantly\\r\\nread her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,\\r\\nresentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\nthan her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\\r\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of\\r\\nany third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good\\r\\nconduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly\\r\\nconvinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention\\r\\nfrom Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by\\r\\nhis account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a\\r\\nrespectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent,\\r\\nand has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\nam satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that\\r\\nit was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth\\r\\nwarmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by\\r\\nassurances only.  Mr. Bingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very\\r\\nable one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several\\r\\nparts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend\\r\\nhimself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\nand on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\r\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest\\r\\nhopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard, and said\\r\\nall in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being\\r\\njoined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss\\r\\nLucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\nshe had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so\\r\\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is\\r\\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I happened to\\r\\noverhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady\\r\\nwho does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss\\r\\nde Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How\\r\\nwonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh in his assembly!  I am most thankful that\\r\\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,\\r\\nwhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not\\r\\nhaving done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection\\r\\nmust plead my apology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am.  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\nearlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s NEPHEW.  It will\\r\\nbe in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\nyesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\\r\\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him\\r\\nwithout introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a\\r\\ncompliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary\\r\\nthere should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it\\r\\nmust belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin\\r\\nthe acquaintance.  Mr. Collins listened to her with the\\r\\ndetermined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:-- \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have\\r\\nthe highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in\\r\\nall matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit\\r\\nme to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\nestablished forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\r\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I\\r\\nconsider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the\\r\\nhighest rank in the kingdom-- provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\\r\\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point\\r\\nof duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,\\r\\nwhich on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\r\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\r\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady\\r\\nlike yourself.\"  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched,\\r\\nand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though\\r\\nshe could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and\\r\\nsaw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\"\\r\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"  It vexed her to see him\\r\\nexpose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\nunrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\ntime to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins,\\r\\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\nof his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\nslight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then returned\\r\\nto Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with\\r\\nmy reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\nattention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\\r\\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never\\r\\nbestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome\\r\\nthought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,\\r\\nshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\nobservations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\nJane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\nfelicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\nfelt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\nlike Bingley\\'s two sisters.  Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\nwere bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\nher, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness\\r\\nwhich placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she\\r\\nvexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person\\r\\n(Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her\\r\\nexpectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.  It\\r\\nwas an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\\r\\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His\\r\\nbeing such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\r\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters\\r\\nwere of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\\r\\nconnection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a\\r\\npromising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so\\r\\ngreatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly,\\r\\nit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her\\r\\nsingle daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be\\r\\nobliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,\\r\\nbecause on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less\\r\\nlikely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any\\r\\nperiod of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that\\r\\nLady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,  though evidently\\r\\nand triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\nmother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less\\r\\naudible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could\\r\\nperceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who\\r\\nsat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\nnonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\r\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\nto say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it\\r\\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?  You will never recommend\\r\\nyourself to his friend by so doing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her\\r\\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\r\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for\\r\\nthough he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The\\r\\nexpression of his face changed gradually from indignant\\r\\ncontempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\nLucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\nwhich she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\nof cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to revive.  But\\r\\nnot long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was\\r\\nover, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of\\r\\nseeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\ncompany.  By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did\\r\\nshe endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in\\r\\nvain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations,\\r\\nand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with\\r\\nan impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\\r\\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a\\r\\nhope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\nthe pause of half a minute began another.  Mary\\'s powers were\\r\\nby no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and\\r\\nher manner affected.  Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\r\\ntalking to Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\\r\\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who\\r\\ncontinued, however, imperturbably grave.  She looked at her\\r\\nfather to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all\\r\\nnight.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second\\r\\nsong, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.  You have\\r\\ndelighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time\\r\\nto exhibit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\\r\\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her\\r\\nfather\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\r\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing,\\r\\nI should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company\\r\\nwith an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,\\r\\nand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.  I\\r\\ndo not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in\\r\\ndevoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly\\r\\nother things to be attended to.  The rector of a parish has much\\r\\nto do.  In the first place, he must make such an agreement for\\r\\ntithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\npatron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that\\r\\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused\\r\\nfrom making as a comfortable as a possible.  And I do not think\\r\\nit of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\nconciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\nthose to whom he owes his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of\\r\\nthat duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected\\r\\nwith the family.\"  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\r\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by\\r\\nhalf the room.  Many stared-- many smiled; but no one looked\\r\\nmore amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously\\r\\ncommended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\nobserved in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a\\r\\nremarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\nto expose themselves as a much as a they could during the\\r\\nevening, it would have been impossible for them to play their\\r\\nparts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it\\r\\nfor Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had\\r\\nescaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be\\r\\nmuch distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\r\\nThat his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such\\r\\nan opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and\\r\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more\\r\\nintolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was\\r\\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\nside, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\nagain, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did\\r\\nshe entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\nintroduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her,\\r\\nthat as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his\\r\\nchief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close\\r\\nto her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a\\r\\nproject.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\\r\\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further\\r\\nnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,\\r\\nquite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt\\r\\nit to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\ncarriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\nwhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished\\r\\naway by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely\\r\\nopened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were\\r\\nevidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They\\r\\nrepulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by\\r\\nso doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very\\r\\nlittle relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\\r\\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of\\r\\ntheir entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had\\r\\nmarked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.\\r\\nMr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.  Mr.\\r\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from\\r\\nthe rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as\\r\\nsteady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even\\r\\nLydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional\\r\\nexclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a\\r\\nviolent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\nLongbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\nassure him how happy he would make them by eating a family\\r\\ndinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\ninvitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\nengaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\nafter his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\nnext day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\npreparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\nshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\nthe course of three or four months.  Of having another daughter\\r\\nmarried to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\nwith considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the\\r\\nleast dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\nmatch were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was\\r\\neclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmade his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without\\r\\nloss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the\\r\\nfollowing Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make\\r\\nit distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\nvery orderly manner, with all the observances, which he\\r\\nsupposed a regular part of the business.  On finding Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\r\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \"May I\\r\\nhope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\nElizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\nwith her in the course of this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!-- yes-- certainly.  I\\r\\nam sure Lizzy will be very happy-- I am sure she can have no\\r\\nobjection, Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"  And, gathering\\r\\nher work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\r\\ncalled out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.  I beg you will not go.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmust excuse me.  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody\\r\\nneed not hear.  I am going away myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.  I desire you to stay where you are.\"\\r\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and\\r\\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\\r\\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth would not oppose such and injunction-- and a\\r\\nmoment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would\\r\\nbe wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat\\r\\ndown again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the\\r\\nfeelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were\\r\\ngone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\nfrom doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\nperfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\nthere NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure\\r\\nyou, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this\\r\\naddress.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\nhowever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\nattentions have been too marked to be mistaken.  Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion\\r\\nof my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings\\r\\non this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state\\r\\nmy reasons for marrying-- and, moreover, for coming into\\r\\nHertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being\\r\\nrun away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,\\r\\nthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt\\r\\nto stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing\\r\\nfor every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set\\r\\nthe example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\nconvinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\nthirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\nis the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\nlady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has\\r\\nshe condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\nHunsford-- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\nwas arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said,  \\'Mr.\\r\\nCollins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry.\\r\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for\\r\\nyour OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought\\r\\nup high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is\\r\\nmy advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to\\r\\nHunsford, and I will visit her.\\'  Allow me, by the way, to\\r\\nobserve, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners\\r\\nbeyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I\\r\\nthink, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with\\r\\nthe silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\r\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it\\r\\nremains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\nLongbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can\\r\\nassure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact\\r\\nis, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of\\r\\nyour honoured father (who, however, may live many years\\r\\nlonger), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\\r\\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as\\r\\nlittle as possible, when the melancholy event takes place-- which,\\r\\nhowever, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\r\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it\\r\\nwill not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains but\\r\\nfor me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent,\\r\\nand shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I\\r\\nam well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one\\r\\nthousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours\\r\\ntill after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be\\r\\nentitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent;\\r\\nand you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall\\r\\never pass my lips when we are married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.  \"You forget that I have\\r\\nmade no answer.  Let me do it without further loss of time.\\r\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.  I am\\r\\nvery sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\nof the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\naddresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when\\r\\nhe first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\nrepeated a second, or even a third time.  I am therefore by no\\r\\nmeans discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\nlead you to the altar ere long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I\\r\\nam not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\nwho are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\nbeing asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\nYou could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am\\r\\nthe last woman in the world who could make you so.  Nay, were\\r\\nyour friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she\\r\\nwould find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr.\\r\\nCollins very gravely-- \"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\nwould at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain when I\\r\\nhave the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\nhighest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\nqualification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.  You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\\r\\ncompliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and\\r\\nvery rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to\\r\\nprevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must\\r\\nhave satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\nfamily, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever\\r\\nit falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be\\r\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\"  And rising as she thus\\r\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not\\r\\nthus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\nyou have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\ncruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\ncustom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\nperhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit\\r\\nas would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you\\r\\npuzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear\\r\\nto you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express\\r\\nmy refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\nyour refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My\\r\\nreasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\nme that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the\\r\\nestablishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\ndesirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of\\r\\nde Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\nhighly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\\r\\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\nmade you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\nlikelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\nqualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\nserious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to\\r\\nyour wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\nusual practice of elegant females.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\\r\\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\r\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\r\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in\\r\\nyour proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My\\r\\nfeelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not\\r\\nconsider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you,\\r\\nbut as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\nexpress authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\nwill not fail of being acceptable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew,\\r\\ndetermined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated\\r\\nrefusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,\\r\\nwhose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be\\r\\ndecisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for\\r\\nthe affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\\r\\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\\r\\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\\r\\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\\r\\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\\r\\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\\r\\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\\r\\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\\r\\ndelicacy of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\\r\\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\\r\\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but\\r\\nshe dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall\\r\\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.  She\\r\\nis a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\ninterest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins;\\r\\n\"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\\r\\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\ncontribute much to my felicity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\\r\\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly\\r\\nto Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr.\\r\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\r\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\\r\\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\\r\\nchange his mind and not have HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\\r\\nthe least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when\\r\\nshe had finished her speech.  \"Of what are you talking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\nLizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\nher marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\\r\\nthe library.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.  \"I have\\r\\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\\r\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?\"  Elizabeth\\r\\nreplied that it was.  \"Very well-- and this offer of marriage you\\r\\nhave refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\\r\\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\\r\\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\\r\\nnever see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\nnever see you again if you DO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\\r\\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to\\r\\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\\r\\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\\r\\nmay be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\\r\\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her\\r\\ndetermination never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\\r\\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s\\r\\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are\\r\\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\\r\\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\\r\\nand she will not have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\\r\\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  \"Pray do, my dear\\r\\nMiss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on\\r\\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\\r\\nfeels for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as\\r\\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\\r\\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\\r\\nyou, Miss Lizzy-- if you take it into your head to go on refusing\\r\\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\\r\\nat all-- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you--\\r\\nand so I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I\\r\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\\r\\nyou again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\\r\\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\\r\\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I\\r\\ndo from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\\r\\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\\r\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\\r\\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\\r\\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\r\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\\r\\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do\\r\\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me\\r\\nand Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\\r\\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the\\r\\nwindow and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\\r\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam, \" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\npoint.  Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that\\r\\nmarked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\r\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\\r\\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\r\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\\r\\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\r\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\\r\\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\\r\\nmy pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid\\r\\nyourself and Mr. Bennet to compliment of requesting you to\\r\\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\\r\\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\\r\\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\\r\\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\nMANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\napologise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\nand Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\nnecessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\nallusions of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, HIS\\r\\nfeelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\ndejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\nand resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour\\r\\nor ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\npride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\nvisit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He\\r\\nwas always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\nto stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\r\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from\\r\\nthe Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town,\\r\\nand attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation,\\r\\nand the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To\\r\\nElizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\\r\\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\nmeet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party\\r\\nwith him for so many hours together, might be more than I could\\r\\nbear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\ncivilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\nwalked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\nparticularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a\\r\\ndouble advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to\\r\\nherself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing\\r\\nhim to her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\\r\\ncame from Netherfield.  The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\nelegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair,\\r\\nflowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change\\r\\nas she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular\\r\\npassages.  Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter\\r\\naway, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general\\r\\nconversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which\\r\\ndrew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had\\r\\nhe and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her upstairs.  When they had gained their\\r\\nown room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, \"This is from\\r\\nCaroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\r\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town-- and without any intention of coming back\\r\\nagain.  You shall hear what she says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\ninformation of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\nto town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these\\r\\nwords: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\nHertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\nwill hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\nunreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.\"  To\\r\\nthese highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\ninsensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\nremoval surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\nwas not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield\\r\\nwould prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of\\r\\ntheir society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard\\r\\nit, in the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should\\r\\nnot be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to\\r\\nwhich Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is\\r\\naware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as\\r\\nfriends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\r\\nMr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\\r\\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in three\\r\\nor four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the\\r\\nsame time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be\\r\\nin no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following\\r\\nhim thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours\\r\\nin a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintances are already\\r\\nthere for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest\\r\\nfriend, had any intention of making one of the crowd-- but of\\r\\nthat I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire\\r\\nmay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings,\\r\\nand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\\r\\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\nSHOULD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing.  He is his\\r\\nown master.  But you do not know ALL.  I WILL read you the\\r\\npassage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves\\r\\nfrom YOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\ntruth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do\\r\\nnot think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\nand accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa\\r\\nand myself is heightened into something still more interesting,\\r\\nfrom the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our\\r\\nsister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you\\r\\nmy feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country\\r\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already; he will\\r\\nhave frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most\\r\\nintimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as\\r\\nhis own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think,\\r\\nwhen I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s\\r\\nheart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and\\r\\nnothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging\\r\\nthe hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\\r\\nJane as she finished it.  \"Is it not clear enough?  Does it not\\r\\nexpressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\nbe her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s\\r\\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for\\r\\nhim, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can\\r\\nthere be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  Will you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall have it in a few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\nbrother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\nto persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.  No one who has ever\\r\\nseen you together can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley, I am\\r\\nsure, cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen\\r\\nhalf as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have\\r\\nordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this: We are not\\r\\nrich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more\\r\\nanxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\r\\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\\r\\ntrouble in achieving a second: in which there is certainly some\\r\\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nwere out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously\\r\\nimagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly\\r\\nadmires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of\\r\\nYOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or\\r\\nthat it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being\\r\\nin love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.  But I know\\r\\nthe foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\ndeceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she\\r\\nis deceiving herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right.  You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\nsince you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be\\r\\ndeceived, by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,\\r\\nand must fret no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\nmarry elsewhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon\\r\\nmature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\ntwo sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\nwife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling.  \"You must\\r\\nknow that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\ndisapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\nconsider your situation with much compassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\nutmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\nCaroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\nsuppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\ncould influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy\\r\\neffect.  Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure\\r\\nof the family, without being alarmed on the score of the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave\\r\\nher a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly\\r\\nunlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they\\r\\nwere all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it,\\r\\nhowever, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at\\r\\nLongbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable\\r\\ndeclaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\\r\\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\nduring the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to\\r\\nMr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  \"It\\r\\nkeeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to\\r\\nyou than I can express.\"  Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\nsatisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the\\r\\nlittle sacrifice of her time.  This was very amiable, but\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\nconception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\ntowards herself.  Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and\\r\\nappearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night,\\r\\nshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been\\r\\nto leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here she did injustice\\r\\nto the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to\\r\\nescape out of Longbourn House the next morning with\\r\\nadmirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself\\r\\nat her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail\\r\\nto conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the\\r\\nattempt known till its success might be known likewise; for\\r\\nthough feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had\\r\\nbeen tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since\\r\\nthe adventure of Wednesday.  His reception, however, was of\\r\\nthe most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an\\r\\nupper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set\\r\\nout to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared\\r\\nto hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\nand as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\nthe day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though\\r\\nsuch a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt\\r\\nno inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with\\r\\nwhich he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from\\r\\nany charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance;\\r\\nand Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\r\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\nconsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.  Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\ntheir daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\nprospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nbegan directly to calculate, with more interest than the\\r\\nmatter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\r\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole\\r\\nfamily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The\\r\\nyounger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two\\r\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were\\r\\nrelieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old\\r\\nmaid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections\\r\\nwere in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\nsensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\nattachment to her must be imaginary.  But still he would be her\\r\\nhusband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\nmarriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\nfor well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.  This preservative she had now\\r\\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\\r\\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least\\r\\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must\\r\\noccasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued\\r\\nbeyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and\\r\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to\\r\\nbe shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\r\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore\\r\\ncharged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\\r\\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A\\r\\npromise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it\\r\\ncould not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by\\r\\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his\\r\\nreturn as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see\\r\\nany of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed\\r\\nwhen the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with\\r\\ngreat politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to\\r\\nsee him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might\\r\\nallow him to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no\\r\\nmeans wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation\\r\\nhere, my good sir?  You had better neglect your relations than\\r\\nrun the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly obliged to\\r\\nyou for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\ntaking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.  Risk anything\\r\\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\nyour coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\nprobable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall\\r\\ntake no offence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited, by\\r\\nsuch affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\nreceive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\nmark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my\\r\\nfair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to\\r\\nrender it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them\\r\\nhealth and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\nequally surprised that he meditated a quick return.  Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\naddresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\nprevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\nthan any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\nwhich often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\nherself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\nhimself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every\\r\\nhope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after\\r\\nbreakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the\\r\\nevent of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying herself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two;\\r\\nbut that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\nfrom possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\nthe bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  My dear Charlotte-- impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\\r\\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on\\r\\nreceiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than\\r\\nshe expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?  Do you think it\\r\\nincredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any\\r\\nwoman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\\r\\nsucceed with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\neffort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the\\r\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that\\r\\nshe wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.  \"You must be\\r\\nsurprised, very much surprised-- so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\nwishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it\\r\\nover, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am\\r\\nnot romantic, you know; I never was.  I ask only a comfortable\\r\\nhome; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connection, and\\r\\nsituation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\nwith him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\nmarriage state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly\"; and after an\\r\\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\r\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left\\r\\nto reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she\\r\\nbecame at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\r\\nThe strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage\\r\\nwithin three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of\\r\\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not\\r\\nsupposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she\\r\\nwould have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\r\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\\r\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her\\r\\nesteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was\\r\\nimpossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\\r\\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\\r\\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter-- to\\r\\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\\r\\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\\r\\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\\r\\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good\\r\\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\\r\\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\ntheir impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\\r\\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\\r\\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\\r\\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\\r\\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\\r\\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\\r\\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\\r\\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\\r\\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\\r\\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\\r\\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\\r\\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive her\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the\\r\\noccasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of\\r\\na most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover\\r\\nthat Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\ndaughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\\r\\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\\r\\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\\r\\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and\\r\\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\\r\\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\\r\\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\\r\\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\\r\\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she\\r\\nwas sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\\r\\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\\r\\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the\\r\\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\\r\\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\r\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\\r\\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\\r\\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\\r\\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\\r\\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\\r\\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\r\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave\\r\\nway only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\r\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\\r\\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\\r\\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\\r\\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\\r\\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear-- not that Bingley was indifferent--\\r\\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s\\r\\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\\r\\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\\r\\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\\r\\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\nattachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\nmore painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\\r\\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\\r\\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\\r\\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane\\'s steady\\r\\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\\r\\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\\r\\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\\r\\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\nlove-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\r\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\\r\\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\\r\\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\\r\\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\\r\\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\r\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\nabhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she\\r\\nconcluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\\r\\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\\r\\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\\r\\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all\\r\\nthis to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\\r\\nshould be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take\\r\\nher place in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\\r\\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\\r\\nthe survivor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\\r\\nof making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.  If it\\r\\nwas not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\nestate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\\r\\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should HE have it more\\r\\nthan anybody else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\\r\\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in\\r\\nLondon for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret\\r\\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\nHertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\\r\\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy\\'s\\r\\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\\r\\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\\r\\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\\r\\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\\r\\nalso with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\\r\\nlatter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\\r\\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\\r\\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\r\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss\\r\\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\\r\\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\\r\\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s\\r\\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.  It\\r\\nwas a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\\r\\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nelse; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or\\r\\nwere suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had\\r\\nbeen aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s\\r\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them\\r\\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\nand its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\\r\\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He\\r\\nwill be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\nsaid nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you\\r\\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\\r\\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to\\r\\nhope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\\r\\nhave not THAT pain. A little time, therefore-- I shall certainly\\r\\ntry to get the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\\r\\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.  Your\\r\\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\nloved you as you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\\r\\nthrew back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.  YOU wish to think all\\r\\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I\\r\\nonly want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\r\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\nencroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.  You need\\r\\nnot.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\nwhom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\ndissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\ninconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\ndependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.  I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\nmention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.  It is unaccountable!\\r\\nIn every view it is unaccountable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\\r\\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\\r\\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\nrespectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\r\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it\\r\\nis a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s\\r\\nsake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our\\r\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\r\\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-\\r\\nminded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must\\r\\nfeel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot\\r\\nhave a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one\\r\\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\\r\\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is\\r\\nprudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I musty think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\\r\\nsomething else.  You mentioned TWO instances.  I cannot\\r\\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me\\r\\nby thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion\\r\\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\\r\\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\\r\\nbe always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing\\r\\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\\r\\nmeans more than it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\\r\\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to\\r\\ndesign,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or\\r\\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\\r\\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s\\r\\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\\r\\nwhat I think of persons you esteem Stop me whilst you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\\r\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\nother woman can secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\\r\\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\\r\\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\\r\\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\\r\\nopposed their brother\\'s.  What sister would think herself at\\r\\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\r\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\\r\\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an\\r\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\\r\\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\\r\\nashamed of having been mistaken-- or, at least, it is light, it is\\r\\nnothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him\\r\\nor his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in\\r\\nwhich it may be understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\nconvince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\r\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  \"So, Lizzy,\" said he\\r\\none day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\\r\\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\\r\\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\\r\\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\\r\\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\\r\\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\\r\\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\\r\\nmust not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\nmother who will make the most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\\r\\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\r\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\\r\\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\\r\\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\\r\\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\r\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there\\r\\nmight be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to\\r\\nthe society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--\\r\\nbut by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\r\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival\\r\\nof Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be\\r\\nalleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his\\r\\nbride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into\\r\\nHertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn\\r\\nwith as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health\\r\\nand happiness again, and promised their father another letter of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\nthe Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\nnature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\nview of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent,\\r\\nelegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\\r\\nnieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there\\r\\nsubsisted a particular regard.  They had frequently been staying\\r\\nwith her in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\r\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.  When\\r\\nthis was done she had a less active part to play.  It became her\\r\\nturn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\nmuch to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\nlast saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\nmarriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got\\r\\nMr. Bingley if she could.  But Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  It is very hard\\r\\nto think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time,\\r\\nhad it not been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer\\r\\nin this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,\\r\\nthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and\\r\\nthat the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The\\r\\nLucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for\\r\\nwhat they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It\\r\\nmakes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own\\r\\nfamily, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before\\r\\nanybody else.  However, your coming just at this time is the\\r\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us,\\r\\nof long sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\nbefore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence\\r\\nwith her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to\\r\\nher nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\nsubject.  \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\nJane,\" said she.  \"I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen\\r\\nso often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\neasily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\naccident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of\\r\\ninconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will\\r\\nnot do for US.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often\\r\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young\\r\\nman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he\\r\\nwas violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\r\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.  It is as\\r\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.  Pray, how\\r\\nVIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every\\r\\ntime they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own\\r\\nball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them\\r\\nto dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\nanswer. Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility\\r\\nthe very essence of love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\nPoor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\nmay not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to\\r\\nYOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with\\r\\nus?  Change of scene might be of service-- and perhaps a little\\r\\nrelief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\npersuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\\r\\nregard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so\\r\\ndifferent a part of town, all our connections are so different, and,\\r\\nas you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable\\r\\nthat they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\nhis friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\nJane in such a part of London!  My dear aunt, how could you\\r\\nthink of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a\\r\\nplace as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a\\r\\nmonth\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were\\r\\nhe once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs\\r\\nwithout him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does\\r\\nnot Jane correspond with his sister?  SHE will not be able to\\r\\nhelp calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\\r\\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s\\r\\nbeing withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the\\r\\nsubject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not\\r\\nconsider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she\\r\\nthought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and\\r\\nthe influence of his friends successfully combated by the more\\r\\nnatural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and\\r\\nthe Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,\\r\\nthan as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house\\r\\nwith her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with\\r\\nher, without any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\nwithout its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided\\r\\nfor the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\nonce sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for\\r\\nhome, some of the officers always made part of it-- of which\\r\\nofficers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these\\r\\noccasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both.  Without\\r\\nsupposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\\r\\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a\\r\\nlittle uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the\\r\\nsubject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\nimprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording\\r\\npleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a\\r\\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\\r\\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he\\r\\nbelonged.  They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;\\r\\nand though Wickham had been little there since the death of\\r\\nDarcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\r\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\r\\nprocuring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\nby character perfectly well.  Here consequently was an\\r\\ninexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection\\r\\nof Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could\\r\\ngive, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of\\r\\nits late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On\\r\\nbeing made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment\\r\\nof him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed\\r\\ndisposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was\\r\\nconfident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\r\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\ngiven on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\nalone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\r\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of\\r\\nspeaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\r\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\naffection which the want of fortune would make so very\\r\\nimprudent.  I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most\\r\\ninteresting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to\\r\\nhave, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is, you\\r\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and\\r\\nwe all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on\\r\\nYOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not\\r\\ndisappoint your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of\\r\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with\\r\\nme, if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.  At present I am not in love\\r\\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all\\r\\ncomparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- and if he\\r\\nbecomes really attached to me-- I believe it will be better that he\\r\\nshould not.  I see the imprudence of it.  Oh! THAT abominable\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest\\r\\nhonour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father,\\r\\nhowever, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt, I\\r\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you\\r\\nunhappy; but since we see every day that where there is\\r\\naffection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want\\r\\nof fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how\\r\\ncan I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if\\r\\nI am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be\\r\\nwisdom  to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\r\\nto be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\r\\nobject.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\r\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\nvery often.  At least, you should not REMIND you mother of\\r\\ninviting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n\"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.  But do\\r\\nnot imagine that he is always here so often.  It is on your\\r\\naccount that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You\\r\\nknow my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\nfor her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\nwhat I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\ninstance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\nresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\nquitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\nwith the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\nBennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\nlength so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\nrepeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"WISHED they\\r\\nmight be happy.\"  Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\nWednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\r\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s\\r\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected\\r\\nherself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went\\r\\ndownstairs together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.  Will you come and see\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,\\r\\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\nthe visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\\r\\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\r\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding took place:  the bride and bridegroom set off for\\r\\nKent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say,\\r\\nor to hear, on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from\\r\\nher friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent\\r\\nas it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\nimpossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\nthat all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\nnot to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\nhad been, rather than what was.  Charlotte\\'s first letters were\\r\\nreceived with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how\\r\\nshe would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare\\r\\npronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point\\r\\nexactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully,\\r\\nseemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which\\r\\nshe could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\r\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was\\r\\nmost friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of\\r\\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth\\r\\nperceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\ntheir safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\nhoped it would be in her power to say something of the\\r\\nBingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\nimpatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\neither seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,\\r\\nhowever, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\nLongbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\nthe town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\nBingley.  \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words,\\r\\n\"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\nher no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore,\\r\\nmy last letter had never reached her.  I inquired after their\\r\\nbrother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\nwas expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was\\r\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say\\r\\nI shall see them soon here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that\\r\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She\\r\\nendeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\nshe could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.  After\\r\\nwaiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\nevery evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\nappear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration\\r\\nof her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\r\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\r\\nprove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\nher better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\nhave been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\r\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do\\r\\nnot think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\nbehaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\r\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\nwith me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I\\r\\nam sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my\\r\\nvisit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\nmeantime.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had\\r\\nno pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\nwas in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\naway I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\nlonger.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very\\r\\nwrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\nadvance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because\\r\\nshe must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need\\r\\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to\\r\\nbe quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\\r\\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,\\r\\nwhatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\r\\namiable.  I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\nfears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must\\r\\nhave met, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am\\r\\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem,\\r\\nby her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself\\r\\nthat he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If\\r\\nI were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted\\r\\nto say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\r\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think\\r\\nonly of what will make me happy-- your affection, and the\\r\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from\\r\\nyou very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\r\\nwith any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am\\r\\nextremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\\r\\nfriends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\r\\nMaria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.-- Yours,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\nat least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\nover.  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\nhim, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\nhe might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s\\r\\naccount, she would make him abundantly regret what he had\\r\\nthrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\nElizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\nher aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his\\r\\nattentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\nand write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but\\r\\nslightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that\\r\\nSHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\r\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\\r\\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now\\r\\nrendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted\\r\\nperhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him\\r\\nfor his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could\\r\\nbe more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\nstruggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\ndesirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\nthe circumstances, she thus went on:-- \"I am now convinced, my\\r\\ndear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\nexperiences that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\ndetest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my\\r\\nfeelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even\\r\\nimpartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\nall, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\nsort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness\\r\\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\nlove with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too\\r\\ndearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart\\r\\nthan I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet\\r\\nopen to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men\\r\\nmust have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\notherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\nsometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February\\r\\npass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had\\r\\nnot at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte,\\r\\nshe soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually\\r\\nlearned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as\\r\\ngreater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\r\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There\\r\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\nchange was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey\\r\\nwould moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the\\r\\ntime drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\r\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled\\r\\naccording to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir\\r\\nWilliam and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending\\r\\na night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\r\\nperfect as plan could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly\\r\\nmiss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\ngoing, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\nanswer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\nfriendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not\\r\\nmake him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to\\r\\ndeserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be\\r\\nadmired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her\\r\\nevery enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--\\r\\ntheir opinion of everybody-- would always coincide, there was a\\r\\nsolicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him\\r\\nwith a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\nthat, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\nthe amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\nthink him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\nMaria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,\\r\\nhad nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were\\r\\nlistened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\r\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too\\r\\nlong.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his\\r\\npresentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out,\\r\\nlike his information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window\\r\\nwatching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was\\r\\nthere to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her\\r\\nface, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the\\r\\nstairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for\\r\\ntheir cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for\\r\\na twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and\\r\\nkindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\nbustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first object was\\r\\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in\\r\\nreply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled\\r\\nto support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was\\r\\nreasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s\\r\\nvisit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations\\r\\noccurring at different times between Jane and herself, which\\r\\nproved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on  Wickham\\'s desertion,\\r\\nand complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\nKing?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where\\r\\ndoes discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you\\r\\nwere afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;\\r\\nand now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\nknow what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s\\r\\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain\\r\\nMY affections because I had no money, what occasion could\\r\\nthere be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,\\r\\nand who was equally poor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\nelegant decorums which other people may observe.  If SHE does\\r\\nnot object to it, why should WE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM.  It only shows her\\r\\nbeing deficient in something herself-- sense or feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.  HE shall be\\r\\nmercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose.  I should be sorry,\\r\\nyou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\nDerbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\nHertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.  Thank\\r\\nHeaven!  I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has\\r\\nnot one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\nrecommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\ndisappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she\\r\\nhad the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her\\r\\nuncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking\\r\\nin the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and\\r\\nher acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\r\\nwhat felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to\\r\\ndisappointment and spleen.  What are young men to rocks and\\r\\nmountains?  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And\\r\\nwhen we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything.  We WILL\\r\\nknow where we have gone-- we WILL recollect what we have\\r\\nseen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together\\r\\nin our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any\\r\\nparticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative\\r\\nsituation.  Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than\\r\\nthose of the generality of travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting\\r\\nto Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\nhad seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\nhealth, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\nsource of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\nbring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\non one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\nhad heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.  The garden sloping to\\r\\nthe road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel\\r\\nhedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and\\r\\nCharlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the\\r\\nsmall gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst\\r\\nthe nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were\\r\\nall out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs.\\r\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\nElizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she\\r\\nfound herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that\\r\\nher cousin\\'s manner were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\ncivility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all\\r\\nher family.  They were then, with no other delay than his\\r\\npointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house;\\r\\nand as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a\\r\\nsecond time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode,\\r\\nand punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\nroom, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\nparticularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\nlost in refusing him.  But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\ncomfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\nrepentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\ncould have so cheerful an air with such a companion.  When\\r\\nMr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\nturned her eye on Charlotte.  Once of twice she could discern a\\r\\nfaint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.  After\\r\\nsitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\nroom, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\ntheir journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\nlarge and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\nattended himself.  To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\nthe exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\nscarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\nfor, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\nbeauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every\\r\\ndirection, and could tell how many tress there were in the most\\r\\ndistant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared\\r\\nwith the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\\r\\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It\\r\\nwas a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\nremains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\naccompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\nhouse, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\nof showing it without her husband\\'s help.  It was rather small,\\r\\nbut well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\narranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth\\r\\ngave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins could be\\r\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout,\\r\\nand by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed\\r\\nhe must be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\ncountry.  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\nMr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I\\r\\nneed not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability\\r\\nand condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured\\r\\nwith some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have\\r\\nscarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my\\r\\nsister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during\\r\\nyour stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\r\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\r\\nwalk home.  Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\r\\nI SHOULD say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has\\r\\nseveral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\r\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of\\r\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was  spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire\\r\\nnews, and telling again what had already been written; and when\\r\\nit closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\nmeditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\nher address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\nhusband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.  She\\r\\nhad also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\nof their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.  A\\r\\nlively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the\\r\\nwhole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she\\r\\nheard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling\\r\\nloudly after her.  She opened the door and met Maria in the\\r\\nlanding place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell\\r\\nyou what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted\\r\\nthe lane, in quest of this wonder!  It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\nlow phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I expected at least that the\\r\\npigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is\\r\\nnot Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\nwith them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She\\r\\nis quite a little creature.  Who would have thought that she could\\r\\nbe so thin and small?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\\r\\nwind.  Why does she not come in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of\\r\\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.  Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high\\r\\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\ncontemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly\\r\\nbowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\nand the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner\\r\\nsaw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their\\r\\ngood fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know\\r\\nthat the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\ncomplete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\\r\\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\\r\\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he\\r\\nknew not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised\\r\\nby her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\\r\\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\\r\\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\\r\\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\\r\\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\\r\\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\\r\\narrival!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\\r\\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\nuncommon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\\r\\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\noverpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette. Her said to\\r\\nElizabeth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\\r\\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\\r\\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\\r\\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\\r\\nto the rest-- there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\\r\\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\\r\\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\npresentation at St. James\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\nmile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\\r\\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\\r\\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\\r\\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was\\r\\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\\r\\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.  She had\\r\\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\\r\\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\\r\\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\\r\\nwithout trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\\r\\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\\r\\nhe would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s Sir William was so\\r\\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\\r\\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\\r\\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\\r\\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\\r\\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\\r\\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\r\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\\r\\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\\r\\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\\r\\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\\r\\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\\r\\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and\\r\\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\\r\\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nshe turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have\\r\\njoined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\r\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the\\r\\nladies.  Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though\\r\\nnot plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\\r\\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\\r\\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\\r\\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them\\r\\nthat it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if\\r\\nhe felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved, and\\r\\nate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\r\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive\\r\\nadmiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any\\r\\ndish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not\\r\\nsupply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak\\r\\nwhenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\r\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh-- the former of whom was\\r\\nengaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a\\r\\nword to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly\\r\\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing\\r\\nher to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\r\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen\\r\\ndid nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\\r\\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\\r\\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\\r\\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that\\r\\nshe was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\\r\\ninquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and\\r\\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\\r\\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\\r\\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\\r\\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\\r\\nthis great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\r\\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\\r\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\\r\\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\\r\\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\\r\\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\\r\\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\\r\\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\\r\\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\\r\\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\r\\nmother\\'s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\r\\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nthen observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\\r\\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I\\r\\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\\r\\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.  Do you\\r\\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! then-- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\r\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---- You\\r\\nshall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of them does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\\r\\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\nas yours.  Do you draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\\r\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\\r\\nbenefit of masters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No governess!  How was that possible? Five daughters brought\\r\\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\\r\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\nnot been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\\r\\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\\r\\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\nI had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\\r\\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\\r\\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\\r\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\\r\\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\\r\\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\\r\\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\\r\\ntell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\\r\\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you\\r\\nhave given me a treasure.\\'  Are any of your younger sisters out,\\r\\nMiss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only the\\r\\nsecond.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\\r\\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps SHE is full young to\\r\\nbe much in company.  But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be\\r\\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\\r\\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\\r\\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\\r\\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\\r\\nkept back on SUCH a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\\r\\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\\r\\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\\r\\nimpertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\nnot conceal your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\\r\\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\\r\\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not\\r\\nrelate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\nfears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\\r\\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking-- stating the\\r\\nmistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\nladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\\r\\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\\r\\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\r\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\r\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of\\r\\nthe coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\r\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called\\r\\non by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at\\r\\nRosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable\\r\\nthan it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her\\r\\nsome trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was\\r\\nvery soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\nlong enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most\\r\\ncomfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William\\r\\nwas with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him\\r\\nout in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went\\r\\naway, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\nbreakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in\\r\\nthe garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\\r\\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.  The\\r\\nroom in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at\\r\\nfirst rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the\\r\\ndining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and\\r\\nhad a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had\\r\\nan excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would\\r\\nundoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they\\r\\nsat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the\\r\\nlane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de\\r\\nBourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming\\r\\nto inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She\\r\\nnot unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\r\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there\\r\\nmight be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not\\r\\nunderstand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then they\\r\\nwere honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing\\r\\nescaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\r\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at\\r\\ntheir work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\\r\\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid\\r\\nin negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do\\r\\nit only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of\\r\\n\\r\\neat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\nmagistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which\\r\\nwere carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the\\r\\ncottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too\\r\\npoor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\nsilence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and\\r\\nplenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice\\r\\na week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\nonly one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\nthe counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few,\\r\\nas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s reach.  This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth,\\r\\nand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;\\r\\nthere were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte,\\r\\nand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\r\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and\\r\\nwhere she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady\\r\\nCatherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of\\r\\nthe park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one\\r\\nseemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\naway.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\\r\\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\ncircle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\narrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\nweeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances\\r\\nwhom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one\\r\\ncomparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she\\r\\nmight be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs\\r\\non him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was\\r\\nevidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming\\r\\nwith the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the\\r\\nhighest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had\\r\\nalready been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas walking the whole morning within view of the lodges\\r\\nopening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest\\r\\n\\r\\nassurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned\\r\\ninto the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.  On the\\r\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\r\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\r\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the\\r\\nyounger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of\\r\\nall the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman\\r\\naccompanied him.  Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s\\r\\nroom, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other,\\r\\ntold the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nwould never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\ncompliment, before their approach was announced by the\\r\\ndoor-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\\r\\nthe room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about\\r\\nthirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\\r\\ngentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look\\r\\nin Hertfordshire-- paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\npleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\nobservation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\\r\\nsome time without speaking to anybody.  At length, however,\\r\\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after\\r\\nthe health of her family.  She answered him in the usual way,\\r\\nand after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have\\r\\nyou never happened to see her there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had\\r\\npassed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he\\r\\nlooked a little confused as he answered that he had never been\\r\\nso fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued\\r\\nno farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\nParsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\nto the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.  It was some\\r\\ndays, however, before they received any invitation thither-- for\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\nnecessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the\\r\\ngentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\nattention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\ncome there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very\\r\\nlittle of Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\ncalled at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\njoined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.  Her ladyship\\r\\nreceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\nno means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and\\r\\nshe was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to\\r\\nthem, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person\\r\\nin the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything\\r\\nwas a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s\\r\\npretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now\\r\\nseated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\nHertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\nand music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\nin that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\nflow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\nas of Mr. Darcy.  HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\nafter a while, shared the feeling, was more openly\\r\\nacknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are\\r\\ntalking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear\\r\\nwhat it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer\\r\\nable to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my\\r\\n\\r\\ndelight.  I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\nspeaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\nwho have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\nnatural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\nproficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\napply.  I am confident that she would have performed\\r\\ndelightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s\\r\\nproficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\r\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\nexcel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such\\r\\nadvice.  She practises very constantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I\\r\\nnext write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\naccount.  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\nto be acquired without constant practice.  I have told Miss\\r\\nBennet several times, that she will never play really well unless\\r\\nshe practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument,\\r\\nshe is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to\\r\\nRosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\r\\nJenkinson\\'s room.  She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in\\r\\nthat part of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and\\r\\nmade no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth\\r\\nof having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to\\r\\nthe instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nlistened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other\\r\\nnephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with\\r\\nhis usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so\\r\\nas to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\r\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\npause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\nto hear me?  I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play\\r\\nso well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n\\r\\nbe frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises at\\r\\nevery attempt to intimidate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you\\r\\ncould not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\nyou; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long\\r\\nenough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally\\r\\nprofessing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\nnotion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am\\r\\nparticularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\nmy real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\npass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nit is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\ndisadvantage in Hertfordshire-- and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\nimpolitic too-- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things\\r\\nmay come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam.  \"I should like to know how he behaves\\r\\namong strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall hear then-- but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\ndreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nyou must know, was at a ball-- and at this ball, what do you\\r\\nthink he did?  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen\\r\\nwere scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one\\r\\nyoung lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\nassembly beyond my own party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  Well,\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I\\r\\nsought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend\\r\\nmyself to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nstill addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  \"Shall we ask him why a\\r\\nman of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\nqualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\\r\\napplying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in\\r\\ntheir concerns, as I often see done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument\\r\\nin the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.  They\\r\\nhave not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the\\r\\nsame expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my\\r\\nown fault-- because I will not take the trouble of practising.  It is\\r\\nnot that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other\\r\\nwoman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.  You have\\r\\nemployed your time much better.  No one admitted to the\\r\\nprivilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.  We neither\\r\\nof us perform to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\nknow what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\nplaying again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\nfor a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\nand could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a\\r\\nvery good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\nAnne\\'s.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\nhealth allowed her to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\ncould she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of\\r\\nhis behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for\\r\\nMiss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry\\r\\nHER, had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on execution\\r\\nand taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of\\r\\ncivility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the\\r\\ninstrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into\\r\\nthe village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the\\r\\ncertain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she\\r\\nthought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that\\r\\napprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she\\r\\nmight escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened,\\r\\nand, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised\\r\\nfor his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all\\r\\nthe ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\\r\\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this\\r\\nemergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in\\r\\nHertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say\\r\\non the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\r\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,\\r\\nhe went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\nwhen you left London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\nshort pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\never returning to Netherfield again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\nspend very little of his time there in the future.  He has many\\r\\nfriends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are\\r\\ncontinually increasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\r\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for\\r\\nthen we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps,\\r\\nMr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience\\r\\nof the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to\\r\\nkeep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up\\r\\nas soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of\\r\\nhis friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined\\r\\nto leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very\\r\\ncomfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\nit when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she did-- and I am sure she could not have bestowed\\r\\nher kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted\\r\\nhim, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an\\r\\nexcellent understanding-- though I am not certain that I consider\\r\\nher marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She\\r\\nseems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\ncertainly a very good match for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a\\r\\nday\\'s journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I should never\\r\\nhave said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\r\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\\r\\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied\\r\\nshe understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane\\r\\nand Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\nher family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\nmany varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\nexpenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\r\\nBut that is not the case HERE.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\ncomfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\njourneys-- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\nNEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"YOU\\r\\ncannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  YOU\\r\\ncannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some\\r\\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper\\r\\nfrom the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued, on either\\r\\nside calm and concise-- and soon put an end to by the entrance\\r\\nof Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.  The\\r\\ntete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\nhad occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\nfew minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone.  \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\nwould never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\\r\\nlikely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\nvarious conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n\\r\\nproceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\nthe more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were\\r\\nover.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\nbilliard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\nin the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\nto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied\\r\\nby their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\ncame because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion\\r\\nwhich of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nreminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by\\r\\nhis evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\nWickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was\\r\\nless captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she\\r\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\ndifficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he\\r\\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\nlips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\nrather than of choice-- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure  to\\r\\nhimself.  He seldom appeared really animated.  Mrs. Collins\\r\\nknew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s\\r\\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\r\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not\\r\\nhave told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\\r\\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend\\r\\nEliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.  She\\r\\nwatched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he\\r\\ncame to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly\\r\\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look\\r\\nwas disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\r\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\\r\\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\nhis being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from\\r\\nthe danger of raising expectations which might only end in\\r\\ndisappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,\\r\\nthat all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose\\r\\nhim to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\nmarrying colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the\\r\\nmost pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in\\r\\nlife was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages,\\r\\nMr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his\\r\\ncousin could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.  She felt all the perverseness of\\r\\nthe mischance that should bring him where no one else was\\r\\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\\r\\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.  How it\\r\\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!  Yet it did,\\r\\nand even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\npenance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\ninquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\nthought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never\\r\\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\r\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\r\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--\\r\\nabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary\\r\\nwalks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and\\r\\nthat in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding\\r\\nthe house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into\\r\\nKent again she would be staying THERE too.  His words\\r\\nseemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\nthoughts?  She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\\r\\nand allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed\\r\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in\\r\\nthe pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing Jane\\'s last\\r\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane\\r\\nhad not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised\\r\\nby Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\nwas meeting her.  Putting away the letter immediately and\\r\\nforcing a smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I\\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the\\r\\nParsonage.  Are you going much farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\nParsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his\\r\\ndisposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.  I do not know\\r\\nanybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\r\\nlikes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam.  \"But so we all do.  It is only that he has better\\r\\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\\r\\nmany others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you\\r\\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\nof either.  Now seriously, what have you ever known of\\r\\nself-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by\\r\\nwant of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring\\r\\nanything you had a fancy for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are home questions-- and perhaps I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters\\r\\nof greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger\\r\\nsons cannot marry where they like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they\\r\\nvery often do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\\r\\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\nattention to money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured\\r\\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And\\r\\npray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?  Unless\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\nabove fifty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.  To\\r\\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\nwhat had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for\\r\\nthe sake of  having someone at his disposal.  I wonder he does\\r\\nnot marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,\\r\\nperhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\nunder his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he\\r\\nmust divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship\\r\\nof Miss Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you\\r\\nmake?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies\\r\\nof her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she\\r\\nhas the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed\\r\\nMiss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her\\r\\nthat she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She\\r\\ndirectly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and\\r\\nI dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard\\r\\nyou say that you know them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\nman-- he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of him!  Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of\\r\\nhim in those points where he most wants care.  From something\\r\\nthat he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think\\r\\nBingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his\\r\\npardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the\\r\\n\\r\\nperson meant.  It was all conjecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it\\r\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\\r\\nbe Bingley.  What he told me was merely this: that he\\r\\ncongratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the\\r\\ninconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\\r\\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected\\r\\nit to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get\\r\\ninto a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been\\r\\ntogether the whole of last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\\r\\nagainst the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\r\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling\\r\\nwith indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked\\r\\nher why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he\\r\\nto be the judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\\r\\npropriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own\\r\\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner\\r\\nhis friend was to be happy.  But,\" she continued, recollecting\\r\\nherself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to\\r\\ncondemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much\\r\\n\\r\\naffection in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\r\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer,\\r\\nand therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on\\r\\nindifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.  There, shut\\r\\ninto her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could\\r\\nthink without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not\\r\\nto be supposed that any other people could be meant than those\\r\\nwith whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the\\r\\nworld TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such\\r\\nboundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the\\r\\nmeasures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never\\r\\ndoubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the\\r\\nprincipal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,\\r\\nhowever,  did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and\\r\\ncaprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still\\r\\ncontinued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of\\r\\nhappiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;\\r\\nand no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections\\r\\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\\r\\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility\\r\\nof objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-- her\\r\\nunderstanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\ncaptivating.  Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\nwho, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\nprobably never each.\"  When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\nconfidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\nobjections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\r\\nthe want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from\\r\\ntheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he\\r\\nhad been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly\\r\\nby the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\na headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening,\\r\\nthat, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined\\r\\nher not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were\\r\\nengaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really\\r\\nunwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible\\r\\nprevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could\\r\\nnot conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\r\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\nherself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\nemployment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\nwritten to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual\\r\\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\ncommunication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost\\r\\nevery line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\nhad been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\nfrom the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\nuneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\nfirst perusal.  Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\nbeen able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s\\r\\nsufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\nRosings was to end on the day after the next-- and, a still\\r\\ngreater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\nJane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without\\r\\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and\\r\\nagreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\nof the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea\\r\\nof its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before\\r\\ncalled late in the evening, and might now come to inquire\\r\\nparticularly after her.  But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n\\r\\nspirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\namazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.  In an\\r\\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,\\r\\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.  She\\r\\nanswered him with cold civility.  He sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence of\\r\\nseveral minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and\\r\\nthus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain I have struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be\\r\\nrepressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\nand love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,\\r\\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient\\r\\nencouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\nfelt for her, immediately followed.  He spoke well; but there\\r\\nwere feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he\\r\\nwas not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of\\r\\npride.  His sense of her inferiority-- of its being a degradation--\\r\\nof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination,\\r\\nwere dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\r\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\\r\\nrecommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible\\r\\nto the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her\\r\\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for\\r\\nthe pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his\\r\\nsubsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.  She\\r\\ntried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience,\\r\\nwhen he should have done.  He concluded with representing to\\r\\nher the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\\r\\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\r\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\nacceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she could easily see that\\r\\nhe had no doubt of a favourable answer.  He SPOKE of\\r\\napprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\nsecurity.  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther,\\r\\nand, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that\\r\\nobligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would\\r\\nnow thank you.  But I cannot-- I have never desired your good\\r\\nopinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I\\r\\n\\r\\nam sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.  It has been most\\r\\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\\r\\nduration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\r\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\r\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his\\r\\neyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\nresentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with\\r\\nanger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every\\r\\nfeature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,\\r\\nand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have\\r\\nattained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.  At\\r\\nlength, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\nexpecting:  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of\\r\\nsmall importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \" why with so evident a\\r\\ndesire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\nyou liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\nagainst your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\nif I WAS uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I\\r\\nhave.  Had not my feelings decided against you-- had they been\\r\\nindifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\r\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a\\r\\nmost beloved sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but\\r\\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting\\r\\nto interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive\\r\\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE.\\r\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal,\\r\\nif not the only means of dividing them from each other-- of\\r\\nexposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and\\r\\n\\r\\ninstability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes,\\r\\nand involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\nfeeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\naffected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of\\r\\ndenying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\nfrom your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I\\r\\nhave been kinder than towards myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\nreflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\nconciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my\\r\\ndislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\nyou was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital\\r\\nwhich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this\\r\\nsubject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of\\r\\nfriendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what\\r\\nmisrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\\r\\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his\\r\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.  \"You\\r\\nhave reduced him to his present state of poverty-- comparative\\r\\npoverty.  You have withheld the advantages which you must\\r\\nknow to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the\\r\\nbest years of his life of that independence which was no less his\\r\\ndue than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can\\r\\ntreat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room, \"Is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in\\r\\nwhich you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My\\r\\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But\\r\\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\\r\\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your\\r\\npride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had\\r\\nlong prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter\\r\\naccusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\r\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief\\r\\nof my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by\\r\\nreason, by reflection, by everything.  But disguise of every sort is\\r\\nmy abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\r\\nThey were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in\\r\\nthe inferiority of your connections?-- to congratulate myself on\\r\\nthe hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly\\r\\nbeneath my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\nyour declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\nthe concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\nbehaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with\\r\\nan expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the very beginning-- from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\nsay-- of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me\\r\\nwith the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\nselfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the\\r\\ngroundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\nbuilt so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\ncould ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend\\r\\nyour feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own\\r\\n\\r\\nhave been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your\\r\\ntime, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\nheard him the next moment open the front door and quit the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.  She knew not\\r\\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and\\r\\ncried for half-an-hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on\\r\\nwhat had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she\\r\\nshould receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  That he\\r\\nshould have been in love with her for so many months!  So much\\r\\nin love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\r\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and\\r\\nwhich must appear at least with equal force in his own case--\\r\\nwas almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired\\r\\nunconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his\\r\\nabominable pride-- his shameless avowal of what he had done\\r\\nwith respect to Jane-- his unpardonable assurance in\\r\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling\\r\\nmanner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty\\r\\ntowards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\\r\\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment\\r\\nexcited.  She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was\\r\\nto encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to\\r\\nher room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\nmeditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not\\r\\nyet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\nimpossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\nemployment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\nherself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\nfavourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes\\r\\ncoming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\nturned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\r\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\npassed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\nwas tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\ngates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now\\r\\npassed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\nevery day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.  She was\\r\\non the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse\\r\\nof a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he\\r\\nwas moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\ndirectly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\nenough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\npronounced her name.  She had turned away; but on hearing\\r\\nherself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that time\\r\\nreached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively\\r\\ntook, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been\\r\\nwalking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will\\r\\nyou do me the honour of reading that letter?\"  And then, with a\\r\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\r\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\r\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper,\\r\\nwritten quite through, in a very close hand.  The envelope itself\\r\\nwas likewise full.  Pursuing her way along the lane, she then\\r\\nbegan it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\nor renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\nyou.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\nmyself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\ncannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\nand the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\nspared had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\r\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly,\\r\\nbut I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\nequal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first\\r\\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had\\r\\ndetached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had,\\r\\nin defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n\\r\\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\nprospects of Mr. Wickham.  Wilfully and wantonly to have\\r\\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\r\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\r\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought\\r\\nup to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the\\r\\nseparation of two young persons, whose affection could be the\\r\\ngrowth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.  But\\r\\nfrom the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\\r\\nbestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the\\r\\nfuture secured, when the following account of my actions and\\r\\ntheir motives has been read.  If, in the explanation of them,\\r\\nwhich is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating\\r\\nfeelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I\\r\\nam sorry.  The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology\\r\\nwould be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other\\r\\nyoung woman in the country.  But it was not till the evening of\\r\\nthe dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\nfeeling a serious attachment.  I had often seen him in love before.\\r\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was\\r\\nfirst made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental\\r\\ninformation, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\nrise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as\\r\\na certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n>From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively;\\r\\nand I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also\\r\\nwatched.  Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and\\r\\nengaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard,\\r\\nand I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that\\r\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not\\r\\ninvite them by any participation of sentiment.  If YOU have not\\r\\nbeen mistaken here, I must have been in error.  Your superior\\r\\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.  If it be\\r\\nso, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your\\r\\nresentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to\\r\\nassert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was\\r\\nsuch as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\r\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\r\\neasily touched.  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent\\r\\nis certain-- but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\ndecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.  I did\\r\\n\\r\\nnot believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it\\r\\non impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.  My\\r\\nobjections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\\r\\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\\r\\ngreat an evil to my friend as to me.  But there were other causes\\r\\nof repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing\\r\\nto an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured\\r\\nto forget, because they were not immediately before me.  These\\r\\ncauses must be stated, though briefly.  The situation of your\\r\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\nalmost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\nsisters, and occasionally even by your father.  Pardon me.  It\\r\\npains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\nof  your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\nthat, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\nyour elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\ndisposition of both.  I will only say farther that from what passed\\r\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\r\\ninducement heightened which could have led me before to\\r\\npreserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\nconnection.  He left Netherfield for London, on the day\\r\\nfollowing, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of\\r\\nsoon returning.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.  His sisters\\'\\r\\nuneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\\r\\ncoincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible\\r\\nthat no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\\r\\nresolved on joining him directly in London.  We accordingly\\r\\nwent-- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out\\r\\nto my friend the certain evils of such a choice.  I described, and\\r\\nenforced them earnestly.  But, however this remonstrance might\\r\\nhave staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\r\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not\\r\\nbeen seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of\\r\\nyour sister\\'s indifference.  He had before believed her to return\\r\\nhis affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  But Bingley\\r\\nhas great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\\r\\njudgement than on his own.  To convince him, therefore, that he\\r\\nhad deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade\\r\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.  I cannot\\r\\nblame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part\\r\\nof my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with\\r\\nsatisfaction; it is, that I condescended to adopt the measures of\\r\\nart so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.  I\\r\\nknew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother\\r\\nis even yet ignorant of it.  That they might have met without ill\\r\\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear\\r\\nto me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\r\\ndanger.  Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me;\\r\\nit is done, however, and it was done for the best.  On this subject\\r\\nI have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.  If I have\\r\\nwounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and\\r\\nthough the motives which governed me may to you very\\r\\nnaturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\ninjured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\nthe whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has\\r\\nPARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of\\r\\nwhat I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of\\r\\nundoubted veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and\\r\\nwhose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally\\r\\ninclined my father to be of service to him; and on George\\r\\nWickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore\\r\\nliberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and\\r\\nafterwards at Cambridge-- most important assistance, as his own\\r\\nfather, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would\\r\\nhave been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.  My\\r\\nfather was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose\\r\\nmanner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of\\r\\nhim, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to\\r\\nprovide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since\\r\\nI first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The\\r\\nvicious propensities-- the want of principle, which he was careful\\r\\nto guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\r\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with\\r\\nhimself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded\\r\\nmoments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again shall\\r\\ngive you pain-- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever\\r\\nmay be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\nreal character-- it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\nwill he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\nallow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\r\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a\\r\\nlegacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long\\r\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved\\r\\nagainst taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\\r\\nunreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\\r\\nadvantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\r\\nbenefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying law,\\r\\nand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,\\r\\nthan believed him to be sincere-- but, at any rate, was perfectly\\r\\nready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon\\r\\nsettled-- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it\\r\\npossible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and\\r\\naccepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection\\r\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him to\\r\\ninvite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town I\\r\\nbelieve he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere\\r\\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life\\r\\nof idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of\\r\\nhim; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had\\r\\nbeen designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the\\r\\npresentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found\\r\\nthe law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\r\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living\\r\\nin question-- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as\\r\\nhe was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\r\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\r\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this\\r\\nentreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.  His resentment\\r\\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-- and he\\r\\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\nreproaches to myself.  After this period every appearance of\\r\\nacquaintance was dropped.  How he lived I know not.  But last\\r\\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to\\r\\nforget myself, and which no obligation less than the present\\r\\nshould induce me to unfold to any human being.  Having said\\r\\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is\\r\\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a\\r\\nyear ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\\r\\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\\r\\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went\\r\\nMr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\\r\\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in\\r\\nwhose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her\\r\\nconnivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to\\r\\nGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression\\r\\nof his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to\\r\\nbelieve herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was\\r\\nthen but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\r\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it\\r\\nto herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\\r\\nintended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\r\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost\\r\\nlooked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You\\r\\nmay imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my sister\\'s\\r\\ncredit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to\\r\\nMr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge\\r\\nwas of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham\\'s object\\r\\nwas unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand\\r\\npounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\r\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would\\r\\nhave been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\r\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of\\r\\ncruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner,\\r\\nunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his\\r\\nsuccess is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you\\r\\npreviously were of everything concerning either.  Detection\\r\\ncould not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\nnight; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\ncould or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of everything here\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and\\r\\nconstant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my\\r\\nfather\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every\\r\\nparticular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of ME\\r\\nshould make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\\r\\nby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there\\r\\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to\\r\\nfind some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you,\\r\\n                                   \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\nit to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\nexpectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may\\r\\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what\\r\\na contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read\\r\\nwere scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first\\r\\nunderstand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\nsteadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a\\r\\nstrong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\naccount of what had happened at Netherfield.  She read with an\\r\\neagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and\\r\\nfrom impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,\\r\\nwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her\\r\\neyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\nto be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\nthe match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\njustice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\nsatisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all\\r\\npride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\nWickham-- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\\r\\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished\\r\\nopinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to\\r\\nhis own history of himself-- her feelings were yet more acutely\\r\\npainful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment,\\r\\napprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.  She wished to\\r\\ndiscredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-- and\\r\\nwhen she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely\\r\\nknowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\\r\\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never\\r\\nlook in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\nletter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\ncould, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\nto Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\nmeaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with\\r\\nthe Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself;\\r\\nand the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not\\r\\nbefore known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\r\\nwords.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she\\r\\ncame to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had\\r\\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled\\r\\nhis very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross\\r\\nduplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she\\r\\nflattered herself that her wishes did not err.  But when she read\\r\\nand re-read with the closest attention, the particulars\\r\\nimmediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to\\r\\nthe living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\r\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put\\r\\ndown the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she\\r\\nmeant to be impartiality-- deliberated on the probability of each\\r\\nstatement-- but with little success.  On both sides it was only\\r\\nassertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly\\r\\nthat the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any\\r\\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct\\r\\nin it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make\\r\\nhim entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not\\r\\nto lay at Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the\\r\\nmore so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had\\r\\nnever heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia,\\r\\nin which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man\\r\\nwho, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a\\r\\nslight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been\\r\\nknown in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real\\r\\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never felt\\r\\na wish of inquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had\\r\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She\\r\\n\\r\\ntried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\r\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\r\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue,\\r\\natone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour\\r\\nto class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of\\r\\nmany years\\' continuance.  But no such recollection befriended\\r\\nher.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of\\r\\nair and address; but she could remember no more substantial\\r\\ngood than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\r\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more\\r\\ncontinued to read.  But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\r\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what\\r\\nhad passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\\r\\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\\r\\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself-- from whom she\\r\\nhad previously received the information of his near concern in all\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to\\r\\nquestion.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\r\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the\\r\\napplication, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\r\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had\\r\\nnot been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\nat Mr. Phillips\\'s.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her\\r\\nmemory.  She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\ncommunications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\nbefore.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\nhad done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\nconduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\r\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy-- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,\\r\\nbut that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the\\r\\nNetherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also that,\\r\\ntill the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his\\r\\nstory to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\\r\\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no\\r\\nscruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured\\r\\nher that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing\\r\\nthe son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\nconcerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the\\r\\nconsequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the\\r\\n\\r\\nmediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his\\r\\nwishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to\\r\\nherself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either\\r\\nbeen deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\r\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she\\r\\nhad most incautiously shown.  Every lingering struggle in his\\r\\nfavour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by\\r\\nJane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that\\r\\nproud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the\\r\\nwhole course of their acquaintance-- an acquaintance which\\r\\nhad latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\nintimacy with his ways-- seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\nunprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\nimmoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\r\\nesteemed and valued-- that even Wickham had allowed him\\r\\nmerit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so\\r\\naffectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some\\r\\namiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\\r\\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could\\r\\nhardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship\\r\\nbetween a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as\\r\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.  Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\nWickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\npartial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided\\r\\nmyself on my discernment!  I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\nabilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\nsister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!  yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.  Pleased with the\\r\\npreference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\nthe very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\\r\\neither were concerned.  Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n>From herself to Jane-- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were\\r\\nin a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nexplanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\nit again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich she had been obliged to give in the other?  He declared\\r\\nhimself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and\\r\\nshe could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had\\r\\nalways been.  Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\ndescription of Jane.  She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent,\\r\\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency\\r\\nin her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\nsense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\ntoo forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\nparticularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and\\r\\nas confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a\\r\\nstronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It\\r\\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\nthus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\nconsidered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\nof her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\nof both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\ndepressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to\\r\\nevery variety of thought--re-considering events, determining\\r\\nprobabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a\\r\\nchange so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\nof her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\nentered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\nand the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\nher unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings\\r\\nhad each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\nminutes, to take leave-- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\nsitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\nalmost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\nElizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she\\r\\nreally rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\nobject; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.\\r\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his\\r\\nparting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\\r\\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\\r\\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene\\r\\nso lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,\\r\\nto console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\r\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her\\r\\nladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her\\r\\nvery desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\nher as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\nwhat her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.  \"What would\\r\\nshe have said? how would she have behaved?\" were questions\\r\\nwith which she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.  \"I\\r\\nassure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe\\r\\nno one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But I am\\r\\nparticularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\nso much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!\\r\\nBut so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\\r\\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\nmore, I think, than last year.  His attachment to Rosings\\r\\ncertainly increases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\nout of spirits. And immediately accounting for it by herself, by\\r\\nsupposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\nthat you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\nof your company, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\"\\r\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.  I must\\r\\nbe in town next Saturday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I\\r\\nexpected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\nyou came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father cannot.  He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if\\r\\nyou will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power\\r\\nto take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\nJune, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\nbarouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--\\r\\nand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\nobject to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by\\r\\nour original plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.  \"Mrs. Collins, you must send\\r\\na servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I\\r\\ncannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by\\r\\nthemselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send\\r\\nsomebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\\r\\nthing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and\\r\\nattended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece\\r\\nGeorgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\r\\nhaving two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have\\r\\nappeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively\\r\\nattentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young\\r\\nladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;\\r\\nfor it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Your uncle!  He keeps a man-servant, does he?  I am very\\r\\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.  Where\\r\\nshall you change horses?  Oh!  Bromley, of course.  If you\\r\\nmention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was\\r\\nnecessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with\\r\\n\\r\\na mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she\\r\\nwas alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\nwent by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all\\r\\nthe delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\nheart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\nwriter were at times widely different.  When she remembered the\\r\\nstyle of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she\\r\\nconsidered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\nher anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\nfeelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment\\r\\nexcited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could\\r\\nnot approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\r\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her\\r\\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation\\r\\nand regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a constant\\r\\nsource of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her\\r\\nfamily, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of\\r\\nremedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would\\r\\nnever exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest\\r\\ndaughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\r\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nfrequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the\\r\\nimprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were\\r\\nsupported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there\\r\\nbe of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and\\r\\ncompletely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted\\r\\nby their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\r\\nscarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\r\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;\\r\\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would\\r\\nbe going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former\\r\\ngood opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His\\r\\naffection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\ncleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\nof his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the\\r\\nthought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\nreplete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\r\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\nweek of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening\\r\\nwas spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into\\r\\nthe particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\nbest method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\nplacing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\nobliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\npack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to\\r\\nHunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so\\r\\nfar as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for\\r\\nbreakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took\\r\\nthe opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\nindispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\nam very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\nher thanks for it.  The favor of your company has been much\\r\\nfelt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one\\r\\nto our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small\\r\\nrooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world,\\r\\nmust make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\r\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the\\r\\ncondescension, and that we have done everything in our power\\r\\nto prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of\\r\\nhappiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and\\r\\nthe pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she\\r\\nhad received, must make HER feel the obliged.  Mr. Collins was\\r\\ngratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\ntime not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and\\r\\nmost fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to  very\\r\\nsuperior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we\\r\\nmay flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\nentirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nfamily is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\nwhich few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You\\r\\nsee how continually we are engaged there.  In truth I must\\r\\nacknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\\r\\nparsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\r\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\nwas obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\nunite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\nwill be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it\\r\\ndoes not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate----\\r\\nBut on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me\\r\\nassure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\\r\\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear\\r\\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\r\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\r\\ncharacter and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed\\r\\nfor each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\nthat was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\nfirmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was\\r\\nnot sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the\\r\\nlady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte!  it was\\r\\nmelancholy to leave her to such society!  But she had chosen it\\r\\nwith her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her\\r\\nvisitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\r\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and\\r\\nall their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.  After\\r\\nan affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\nattended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked\\r\\ndown the garden he was commissioning her with his best\\r\\nrespects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\\r\\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He\\r\\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\\r\\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\\r\\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any\\r\\nmessage for the ladies at Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\nkindness to you while you have been here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\nshut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it\\r\\nseems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\nthings have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\ntwice!  How much I shall have to tell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to\\r\\nconceal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\nreached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\nstudying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\nkindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go\\r\\nhome with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough\\r\\nfor observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait\\r\\neven for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nproposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what\\r\\nwould so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,\\r\\nso highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet\\r\\nbeen able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as\\r\\nnothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in\\r\\nwhich she remained as to the extent of what she should\\r\\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might\\r\\nonly grieve her sister further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\nset out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in\\r\\nHertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived,\\r\\nin token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia\\r\\nlooking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been\\r\\nabove an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an\\r\\nopposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a\\r\\nsalad and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\\r\\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"Is not this nice?  Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must\\r\\nlend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out\\r\\nthere.\"  Then, showing her purchases-- \"Look here, I have\\r\\nbought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought\\r\\nI might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I\\r\\nget home, and see if I can not make it up any better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\nshop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to\\r\\ntrim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will\\r\\nnot much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire\\r\\nhave left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\\r\\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such\\r\\na delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\nall.  Mamma would like to go too of all things!  Only think what\\r\\na miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful scheme\\r\\nindeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!\\r\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been\\r\\n\\r\\noverset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly\\r\\nballs of Meryton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat\\r\\ndown at table.  \"What do you think?  It is excellent news--\\r\\ncapital news-- and about a certain person we all like!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\nhe need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You\\r\\nthought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he\\r\\noften hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is\\r\\nan ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long\\r\\nchin in my life.  Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\nWickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger\\r\\nof Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.  There\\'s for you!  She is\\r\\ngone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.  Wickham is\\r\\nsafe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\\r\\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said\\r\\nJane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure there is not on HIS.  I will answer for it, he never\\r\\ncared three straws about her-- who could about such a nasty\\r\\nlittle freckled thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\ncoarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\nSENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\\r\\nharboured and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\ntheir boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\nof Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia.  \"I am glad I\\r\\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\nbandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and\\r\\n\\r\\ntalk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us\\r\\nhear what has happened to you all since you went away.  Have\\r\\nyou seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in\\r\\ngreat hopes that one of you would have got a husband before\\r\\nyou came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\r\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!  My aunt Phillips wants you so\\r\\nto get husbands, you can\\'t think.  She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\ntaken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been\\r\\nany fun in it.  Lord! how I should like to be married before any\\r\\nof you!  and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\r\\nDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at\\r\\nColonel Forster\\'s.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there,\\r\\nand Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;\\r\\n(by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\\r\\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so\\r\\nPen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think\\r\\nwe did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on\\r\\npurpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!  Not a soul\\r\\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me,\\r\\nexcept my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her\\r\\ngowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When\\r\\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\\r\\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I\\r\\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.  I thought I should have died.\\r\\nAnd THAT made the men suspect something, and then they\\r\\nsoon found out what was the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\namuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlistened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the\\r\\nfrequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\nsee Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during\\r\\ndinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\\r\\nwere the subjects that occupied them:  Lady Lucas was inquiring\\r\\nof Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an\\r\\naccount of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\r\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other\\r\\nperson\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\\r\\nto anybody who would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\nsuch fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\npretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have\\r\\ngone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got\\r\\nto the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we\\r\\ntreated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the\\r\\nworld, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you\\r\\ntoo.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought\\r\\nwe never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of\\r\\nlaughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we\\r\\ntalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us\\r\\nten miles off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\nsister, to depreciate such pleasures!  They would doubtless be\\r\\ncongenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess\\r\\nthey would have no charms for ME-- I should infinitely prefer a\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened\\r\\nto anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to\\r\\nMary at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\nwalk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\\r\\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said\\r\\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason\\r\\ntoo for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again,\\r\\nand was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to\\r\\nHER of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\r\\nexpression.  In a fortnight they were to go-- and once gone, she\\r\\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the\\r\\ninn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\r\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest\\r\\nintention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so\\r\\nvague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\r\\n\\r\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to\\r\\nsuppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and\\r\\npreparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next\\r\\nmorning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\nsisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\nperfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\nfeelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\nsentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\nstill more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s\\r\\nrefusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and\\r\\ncertainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\nmust increase his disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\nhas other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\nregard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blame you!  Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\nnext day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\nas far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was\\r\\nthis for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the\\r\\nworld without believing that so much wickedness existed in the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\r\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,\\r\\n\\r\\ncapable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did\\r\\nshe labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the\\r\\none without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to\\r\\nmake both of them good for anything.  Take your choice, but\\r\\nyou must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity\\r\\nof merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of\\r\\nman; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my\\r\\npart, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as\\r\\nyou choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted\\r\\nfrom Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\r\\nSuch a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill\\r\\nopinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is\\r\\nreally too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\\r\\nyou so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice,\\r\\nthat I am growing every moment more unconcerned and\\r\\nindifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament\\r\\nover him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the\\r\\neducation of those two young men.  One has got all the\\r\\ngoodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE\\r\\nof it as you used to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\\r\\na dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one\\'s\\r\\ngenius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\none cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\nstumbling on something witty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\ntreat the matter as you do now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\nunhappy.  And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no\\r\\nJane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\\r\\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!  Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\nexpressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\nDO appear wholly undeserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\nmost natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\nencouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.  I\\r\\nwant to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\nacquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can\\r\\nbe no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not\\r\\nauthorised me to make his communication public.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\\r\\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to\\r\\nundeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe\\r\\nme?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that\\r\\nit would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to\\r\\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.\\r\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\r\\nanyone here what he really is.  Some time hence it will be all\\r\\nfound out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not\\r\\nknowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\nhim for ever.  He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,\\r\\nand anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him\\r\\ndesperate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\nfor a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\nwhenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was\\r\\nstill something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nletter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\nvalued by her friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one\\r\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a\\r\\nperfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\r\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.  \"And then,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall\\r\\nmerely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more\\r\\nagreeable manner himself.  The liberty of communication cannot\\r\\nbe mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\nreal state of her sister\\'s spirits.  Jane was not happy.  She still\\r\\ncherished a very tender affection for Bingley.  Having never even\\r\\nfancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\nfirst attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\nsteadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\nfervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\nother man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of\\r\\nthose regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\nand their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion\\r\\nNOW of this sad business of Jane\\'s?  For my part, I am\\r\\ndetermined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my\\r\\nsister Phillips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\nsaw anything of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\nyoung man-- and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the\\r\\nworld of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his\\r\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired\\r\\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\nif I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort\\r\\nis, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be\\r\\nsorry for what he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\nexpectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only\\r\\nhope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep?  Charlotte\\r\\nis an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\nmother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\nTHEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes.\\r\\nTHEY will take care not to outrun their income.  THEY will\\r\\nnever be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do\\r\\nthem!  And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  They look upon it as quite their own,\\r\\nI dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\\r\\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can\\r\\nbe easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\nbetter.  I should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\nentailed on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\nyoung ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.  The\\r\\ndejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone\\r\\nwere still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual\\r\\ncourse of their employments.  Very frequently were they\\r\\nreproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own\\r\\nmisery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\r\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us?  What are we to do?\"\\r\\nwould they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe.  \"How can\\r\\nyou be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty\\r\\nyears ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\\r\\nColonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.  I thought I should have\\r\\nbroken my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!-- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of\\r\\ngood,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\\r\\nthrough Longbourn House.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\\r\\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew\\r\\nthe justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so\\r\\nmuch disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\ncolonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This\\r\\ninvaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\nmarried.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\nrecommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their\\r\\nTHREE months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\nForster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\nKitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\nsister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,\\r\\ncalling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking\\r\\nwith more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued\\r\\nin the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her\\r\\naccent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as\\r\\nLydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend.  I\\r\\nhave just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\nI am two years older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane\\r\\nto make her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation\\r\\nwas so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\nand Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\npossibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such\\r\\na step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly\\r\\nadvising her father not to let her go.  She represented to him all\\r\\nthe improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little\\r\\nadvantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman\\r\\nas Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\ntemptations must be greater than at home.  He heard her\\r\\nattentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\nso little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\npresent circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\nLydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner-- nay, which has\\r\\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in\\r\\nthe affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet.  \"What, has she\\r\\nfrightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But do\\r\\nnot be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be\\r\\nconnected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come,\\r\\nlet me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by\\r\\nLydia\\'s folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent.  It is\\r\\nnot of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\ncomplaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world\\r\\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain\\r\\nof all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.  Excuse me, for I\\r\\nmust speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the\\r\\ntrouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her\\r\\nthat her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she\\r\\nwill soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will\\r\\nbe fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\r\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction\\r\\nbeyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance\\r\\n\\r\\nand emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any\\r\\nportion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration\\r\\nwill excite.  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.  She will\\r\\nfollow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant, idle, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrolled!  Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it\\r\\npossible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\r\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved\\r\\nin the disgrace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane\\r\\nare known you must be respected and valued; and you will not\\r\\nappear to less advantage for having a couple of-- or I may say,\\r\\nthree-- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if\\r\\nLydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go, then.  Colonel\\r\\nForster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real\\r\\nmischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to\\r\\nanybody.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a\\r\\ncommon flirt than she has been here.  The officers will find\\r\\nwomen better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that\\r\\nher being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any\\r\\nrate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising\\r\\nus to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her\\r\\nown opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed\\r\\nand sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\nvexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having\\r\\nperformed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\naugment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her\\r\\nconference with her father, their indignation would hardly have\\r\\nfound expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia\\'s\\r\\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised ever possibility of\\r\\nearthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the\\r\\nstreets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw\\r\\nherself  the object to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\nunknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp-- its tents\\r\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\\r\\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to\\r\\ncomplete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,\\r\\ntenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\nand such realities as these, what would have been her\\r\\nsensations?  They could have been understood only by her\\r\\nmother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia\\'s going to\\r\\nBrighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction\\r\\nof her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\nraptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\nLydia\\'s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\\r\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return,\\r\\nagitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality\\r\\nentirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness\\r\\nwhich had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to\\r\\ndisgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself,\\r\\nmoreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\ninclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\nafter what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern\\r\\nfor him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle\\r\\nand frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could\\r\\nnot but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however\\r\\nlong, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn,\\r\\nher vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any\\r\\ntime by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\ndined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was\\r\\nElizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his\\r\\nmaking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\npassed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and\\r\\nasked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\nseen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.  Her\\r\\nanswer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he\\r\\nsoon afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape\\r\\nher.  \"And pray, may I ask?-- \"  But checking himself, he added,\\r\\nin a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?  Has he\\r\\ndeigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?-- for I dare\\r\\nnot hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that\\r\\nhe is improved in essentials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth.  \"In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\nmuch what he ever was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\\r\\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\r\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him\\r\\nlisten with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\nthat, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\nunderstood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\nagitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\nhis embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\ngentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will\\r\\nreadily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise\\r\\nenough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right.\\r\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,\\r\\nto many others, for it must only deter him from such foul\\r\\nmisconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of\\r\\ncautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\r\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nand judgement he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has\\r\\nalways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good\\r\\ndeal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with\\r\\nMiss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\\r\\nby a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to\\r\\nengage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in\\r\\nno humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\nthe APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with\\r\\nno further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at\\r\\nlast with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\nmeeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next\\r\\nmorning.  The separation between her and her family was rather\\r\\nnoisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but\\r\\nshe did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse\\r\\nin her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and\\r\\nimpressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\r\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible-- advice\\r\\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended\\r\\nto; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding\\r\\nfarewell, the more gentle adieux of her sisters were uttered\\r\\nwithout being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth\\r\\nand beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth\\r\\nand beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak\\r\\nunderstanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage\\r\\nput and end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and\\r\\nconfidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic\\r\\nhappiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\r\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his\\r\\nown imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which\\r\\ntoo often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.  He\\r\\nwas fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had\\r\\narisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had\\r\\ncontributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness\\r\\nwhich a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but\\r\\nwhere other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\r\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\nher father\\'s behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with\\r\\npain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate\\r\\ntreatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could\\r\\nnot overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual\\r\\nbreach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing\\r\\nhis wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly\\r\\nreprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the\\r\\ndisadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a\\r\\nmarriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from\\r\\nso ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\r\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\\r\\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she\\r\\nfound little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\\r\\nregiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and\\r\\nat home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at\\r\\nthe dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over\\r\\ntheir domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\nnatural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\nremoved, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\nmight be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\nand assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\nwatering-place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she\\r\\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an\\r\\nevent to which she had been looking with impatient desire did\\r\\nnot, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised\\r\\nherself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other\\r\\nperiod for the commencement of actual felicity-- to have some\\r\\nother point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and\\r\\nby again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for\\r\\nthe present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour\\r\\nto the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was\\r\\nher best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and\\r\\ncould she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\\r\\nwould have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish\\r\\nfor.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\nwould be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\nsource of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\nhave all my expectations of pleasure realised.  A scheme of\\r\\nwhich every part promises delight can never be successful; and\\r\\ngeneral disappointment is only warded off by the defence of\\r\\nsome little peculiar vexation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and\\r\\nvery minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were\\r\\nalways long expected, and always very short.  Those to her\\r\\nmother contained little else than that they were just returned\\r\\nfrom the library, where such and such officers had attended\\r\\nthem, and where she had seen such beautiful  ornaments as made\\r\\nher quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\r\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave\\r\\noff in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were\\r\\ngoing off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\\r\\nsister,  there was still less to be learnt-- for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\nthough rather longer, were much too full of lines under the\\r\\nwords to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\ngood humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in\\r\\ntown for the winter came back again, and summer finery and\\r\\nsummer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her\\r\\nusual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was\\r\\nso much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;\\r\\nan event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that\\r\\nby the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable\\r\\nas not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some\\r\\ncruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another\\r\\nregiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\nletter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\ncommencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\nprevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\nJuly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\nleft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much\\r\\nas they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\ncomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n\\r\\nLakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\nthe present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\nDerbyshire.  In that county there was enough to be seen to\\r\\noccupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it\\r\\nhad a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had\\r\\nformerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now\\r\\nto spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her\\r\\ncuriosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\r\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\nenough.  But it was her business to be satisfied-- and certainly\\r\\nher temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas\\r\\nconnected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without\\r\\nthinking of Pemberley and its owner.  \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\\r\\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were\\r\\nto pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.  But they did\\r\\npass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children,\\r\\ndid at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six\\r\\nand eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under\\r\\nthe particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\nfavourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper\\r\\nexactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--\\r\\nteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\\r\\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and\\r\\namusement.  One enjoyment was certain-- that of suitableness of\\r\\ncompanions; a suitableness which comprehended health and\\r\\ntemper to bear inconveniences-- cheerfulness to enhance every\\r\\npleasure-- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it\\r\\namong themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\ntheir route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\nBirmingham, &c., are sufficiently known.  A small part of\\r\\nDerbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of\\r\\nLambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained,\\r\\nthey bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders\\r\\nof the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\\r\\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in\\r\\ntheir direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In\\r\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\nexpressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner\\r\\ndeclared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her\\r\\napprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\nheard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so\\r\\nmany of your acquaintances are connected.  Wickham passed all\\r\\nhis youth there, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at\\r\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\nit.  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\ngoing over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\nsatin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  If it were merely a fine\\r\\nhouse richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it\\r\\nmyself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the\\r\\nfinest woods in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said no more-- but her mind could not acquiesce.  The\\r\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\ninstantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the\\r\\nvery idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her\\r\\naunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were\\r\\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\\r\\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\\r\\nwere unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\\r\\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\r\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,\\r\\nwhether the family were down for the summer?  A most\\r\\nwelcome negative followed the last question-- and her alarms\\r\\nnow being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\r\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\\r\\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could\\r\\nreadily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had\\r\\nnot really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore,\\r\\nthey were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\nof Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at\\r\\nlength they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high\\r\\nflutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\ntime through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They\\r\\ngradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\\r\\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\\r\\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated\\r\\non the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some\\r\\nabruptness wound.  It was a large, handsome stone building,\\r\\nstanding well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\r\\nwoody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance\\r\\nwas swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\r\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwas delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had\\r\\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little\\r\\ncounteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm\\r\\nin their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be\\r\\nmistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\ndoor; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\nher apprehension of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded\\r\\nlest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see\\r\\nthe place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as\\r\\nthey waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her\\r\\nbeing where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\\r\\nmuch less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of\\r\\nfinding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was\\r\\na large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\r\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy\\r\\nits prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, which they had\\r\\ndescended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\r\\nwas a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was\\r\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees\\r\\nscattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as\\r\\nshe could trace it, with delight.  As they passed into other\\r\\nrooms these objects were taking different positions; but from\\r\\nevery window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were\\r\\nlofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune\\r\\nof its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,\\r\\nthat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\r\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\r\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\nthem as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle\\r\\nand aunt.  But no,\" recollecting herself-- \"that could never be;\\r\\nmy uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not\\r\\nhave been allowed to invite them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lucky recollection-- it saved her from something\\r\\nvery like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master\\r\\nwas really absent, but had not the courage for it.  At length\\r\\nhowever, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned\\r\\naway with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,\\r\\nadding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of\\r\\nfriends.\"  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey\\r\\nhad not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached\\r\\nand saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst\\r\\nseveral other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.  Her aunt asked\\r\\nher, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward,\\r\\nand told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of\\r\\nher late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at\\r\\nhis own expense.  \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\r\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\nminiatures, \"is my master-- and very like him.  It was drawn at\\r\\nthe same time as the other-- about eight years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.  But,\\r\\nLizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery\\r\\nupstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these\\r\\nminiatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\\r\\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight\\r\\nyears old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and\\r\\nso accomplished!-- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next\\r\\nroom is a new instrument just come down for her-- a present\\r\\nfrom my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\nencouraged her communicativeness by his questions and\\r\\nremarks:  Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\\r\\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\nhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the\\r\\nsummer months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be.  I do not\\r\\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n\"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\\r\\nknows him,\" replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was\\r\\ngoing pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment\\r\\nas the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\\r\\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\\r\\nfour years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\nto her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been\\r\\nher firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she\\r\\nlonged to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You\\r\\nare lucky in having such a master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.  If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\ncould not meet with a better.  But I have always observed, that\\r\\nthey who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\\r\\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,\\r\\nmost generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.  \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\nthought she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\nhim-- just as affable to the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\nmore.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\nrelated the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,\\r\\nand the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly\\r\\namused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed\\r\\nher excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to\\r\\nthe subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as\\r\\nthey proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that\\r\\never lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\nnothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\nservants but will give him a good name.  Some people call him\\r\\nproud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.  To my fancy, it\\r\\nis only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n\"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a\\r\\nvery pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance\\r\\nand lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that\\r\\nit was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\ntaken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\ntowards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she\\r\\nshould enter the room.  \"And this is always the way with him,\"\\r\\nshe added.  \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to\\r\\nbe done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\nwere all that remained to be shown.  In the former were many\\r\\ngood paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from\\r\\nsuch as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned\\r\\nto look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose\\r\\nsubjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\nhave little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked in\\r\\nquest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\nAt last it arrested her-- and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered\\r\\nto have sometimes seen when he looked at her.  She stood\\r\\nseveral minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation,\\r\\nand returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs.\\r\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\r\\nlifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more\\r\\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\nthe height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed\\r\\non him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise\\r\\nis more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a\\r\\nbrother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s\\r\\nhappiness were in his guardianship!-- how much of pleasure or\\r\\npain was it in his power to bestow!-- how much of good or evil\\r\\nmust be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward\\r\\nby the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\r\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed\\r\\nhis eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper\\r\\nsentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\\r\\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\nbeen seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met\\r\\nthem at the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\nturned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\nwhile the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\nthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\nwhich led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.  Their\\r\\neyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\nthe deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment\\r\\nseemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself,\\r\\nadvanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in\\r\\nterms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to\\r\\nbe overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to\\r\\nthe picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to\\r\\nassure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the\\r\\ngardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,\\r\\nmust immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while\\r\\nhe was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\r\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\\r\\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\r\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted,\\r\\nevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her\\r\\nembarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her\\r\\nbeing found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in\\r\\nwhich they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\r\\nher life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,\\r\\nhis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\r\\ninquiries as to the time of  her having left Longbourn, and of her\\r\\nhaving stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,\\r\\nas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\nfew moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\nhimself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed\\r\\nby her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was\\r\\noverpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was\\r\\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\r\\nHow strange it must appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light\\r\\nmight it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had\\r\\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she\\r\\ncome?  Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\r\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been\\r\\nbeyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\\r\\nwas that moment arrived-- that moment alighted from his horse\\r\\nor his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the\\r\\nperverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly\\r\\naltered-- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her\\r\\nwas amazing!-- but to speak with such civility, to inquire after\\r\\nher family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little\\r\\ndignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this\\r\\nunexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last\\r\\naddress in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\r\\nShe  knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or\\r\\na finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but\\r\\nit was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\nthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of\\r\\nher uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such\\r\\nobjects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the\\r\\nscene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of\\r\\nPemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\r\\nwas.  She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\\r\\nhis mind-- in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in\\r\\ndefiance of everything, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he\\r\\nhad been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had\\r\\nbeen THAT in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he\\r\\nhad felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not\\r\\ntell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\\r\\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\\r\\nappearing more like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\nwhile, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\\r\\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\\r\\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,\\r\\nwith the long range of woods overspreading many, and\\r\\noccasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\r\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a\\r\\nwalk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten\\r\\nmiles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the\\r\\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,\\r\\nin a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water,\\r\\nand one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple\\r\\nbridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a\\r\\nspot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley,\\r\\nhere contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\r\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which\\r\\nbordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when\\r\\nthey had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\\r\\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go\\r\\nno farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,\\r\\nand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side\\r\\nof the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was\\r\\nslow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste,\\r\\nwas very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching\\r\\nthe occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and\\r\\ntalking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\r\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again\\r\\nsurprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what\\r\\nit had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them,\\r\\nand at no great distance.  The walk here being here less\\r\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\nthey met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\nprepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear\\r\\nand to speak with calmness, if we really intended to meet them.\\r\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably\\r\\nstrike into some other path.  The idea lasted while a turning in\\r\\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he\\r\\nwas immediately before them.  With a glance, she saw that he\\r\\nhad lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\r\\npoliteness, she began as they to admire the beauty of the place;\\r\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and\\r\\n\"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she\\r\\nfancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\\r\\nmischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\nhe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him\\r\\nto her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\nquite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\nbeing now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very\\r\\npeople against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to\\r\\nherself.  \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he\\r\\nknows who they are?  He takes them now for people of\\r\\nfashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\\r\\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,\\r\\nto see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of\\r\\nhis decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful\\r\\ncompanions.  That he was SURPRISED by the connection was\\r\\nevident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from\\r\\ngoing away, turned his back with them, and entered into\\r\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be\\r\\npleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should\\r\\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to\\r\\nblush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between\\r\\nthem, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her\\r\\nuncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often\\r\\nas he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering\\r\\nat the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing\\r\\nout those parts of the stream where there was usually most\\r\\nsport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\nElizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth\\r\\nsaid nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\r\\nmust be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was\\r\\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so\\r\\naltered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for ME-- it\\r\\ncannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened.  My\\r\\nreproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It\\r\\nis impossible that he should still love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after\\r\\ndescending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of\\r\\nsome curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\r\\nIt originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of\\r\\nthe morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support,\\r\\nand consequently preferred her husband\\'s.  Mr. Darcy took her\\r\\nplace by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short\\r\\nsilence, the lady first spoke.  She wished him to know that she\\r\\nhad been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\\r\\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\r\\nvery unexpected-- \"for your housekeeper,\" she added,\\r\\n\"informed us that you would certainly not be here till\\r\\nto-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we\\r\\nunderstood that you were not immediately expected in the\\r\\ncountry.\"  He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\r\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a\\r\\nfew hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been\\r\\ntravelling.  \"They will join me early to-morrow ,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with\\r\\nyou-- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were\\r\\ninstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had\\r\\nbeen the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge\\r\\nby his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after\\r\\na pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\r\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister\\r\\nto your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.  She\\r\\nimmediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\nbeing acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\nwithout looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to\\r\\nknow that is resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\nflattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\nwas a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\nothers, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house-- but she declared\\r\\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such\\r\\na time much might have been said, and silence was very\\r\\nawkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\\r\\nembargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had\\r\\nbeen travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\r\\ngreat perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-- and\\r\\nher patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the\\r\\ntete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up\\r\\nthey were all pressed to go into the house and take some\\r\\nrefreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\\r\\nside with utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\\r\\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\\r\\nslowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\nthem pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\nhad expected.  \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\nunassuming,\" said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\r\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can\\r\\nnow say with the housekeeper, that though some people may\\r\\ncall him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was\\r\\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity\\r\\nfor such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very\\r\\ntrifling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as\\r\\nWickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for\\r\\nhis features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell me\\r\\nthat he was so disagreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\nshe had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\\r\\nreplied her uncle.  \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\\r\\nbut said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I\\r\\nreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\ncruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.  He\\r\\nhas not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something\\r\\npleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is\\r\\nsomething of dignity in his countenance that would not give one\\r\\nan unfavourable idea of his heart.  But, to be sure, the good lady\\r\\nwho showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\r\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal\\r\\nmaster, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant\\r\\ncomprehends every virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\\r\\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that\\r\\nby what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions\\r\\nwere capable of a very different construction; and that his\\r\\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable,\\r\\nas they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation\\r\\nof this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\r\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually\\r\\nnaming her authority, but stating as such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were\\r\\nnow approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea\\r\\ngave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much\\r\\nengaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots\\r\\nin its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had\\r\\nbeen by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she\\r\\nset off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the\\r\\nevening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed\\r\\nafter many years\\' discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\nElizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\ncould do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be\\r\\nacquainted with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\nvisit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\nconsequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\nof that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\nmorning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\r\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new\\r\\nfriends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves\\r\\nfor dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage\\r\\ndrew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\\r\\nin a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately\\r\\nrecognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no\\r\\nsmall degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them\\r\\nwith the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were\\r\\nall amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she\\r\\nspoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea\\r\\non the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they\\r\\nfelt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions\\r\\nfrom such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\r\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\\r\\nperturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment\\r\\nincreasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but\\r\\namongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality\\r\\nof the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more\\r\\nthan commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that\\r\\nevery power of pleasing would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose\\r\\nherself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and\\r\\naunt as made everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\nintroduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see\\r\\nthat her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as\\r\\nherself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss\\r\\nDarcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few\\r\\nminutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She\\r\\nfound it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a\\r\\nmonosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\nthough little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\nappearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than\\r\\nher brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face,\\r\\nand her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\r\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and\\r\\nunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was\\r\\nmuch relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\nBingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\nto express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\nBingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\nentered the room.  All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been\\r\\nlong done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have\\r\\nstood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\nexpressed himself on seeing her again.  He inquired in a friendly,\\r\\nthough general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\nthe same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\npersonage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.\\r\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\r\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their\\r\\nniece directed their observation towards each with an earnest\\r\\nthough guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those\\r\\ninquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\r\\nit was to love.  Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in\\r\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration\\r\\nwas evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to\\r\\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to\\r\\ncompose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\\r\\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\\r\\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give\\r\\npleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,\\r\\nGeorgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and,\\r\\noh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were\\r\\ndirected in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\ntalked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\nherself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to\\r\\ntrace a resemblance .  But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\ncould not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who\\r\\nhad been set up as a rival to Jane.  No look appeared on either\\r\\nside that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between\\r\\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she\\r\\nwas soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\r\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,\\r\\ndenoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,\\r\\nand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,\\r\\nhad he dared.  He observed to her, at a moment when the others\\r\\nwere talking together, and in a tone which had something of real\\r\\nregret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing her\"; and, before she could reply, he added,\\r\\n\"It is above eight months.  We have not met since the 26th of\\r\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\\r\\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.\\r\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding\\r\\nremark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\\r\\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\nwhich she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its\\r\\nexistence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she\\r\\nsaw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good\\r\\nopinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago\\r\\nwould have been a disgrace-- when she saw him thus civil, not\\r\\nonly to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly\\r\\ndisdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford\\r\\nParsonage-- the difference, the change was so great, and struck\\r\\nso forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her\\r\\nastonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of\\r\\nhis dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\\r\\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\r\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no\\r\\nimportance could result from the success of his endeavours, and\\r\\nwhen even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions\\r\\nwere addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of\\r\\nthe ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when\\r\\nthey arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him\\r\\nin expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the\\r\\ncountry.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked\\r\\nher little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.  Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE,\\r\\nwhom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\r\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.  Presuming\\r\\nhowever, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\\r\\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her\\r\\nhusband, who was fond or society, a perfect willingness to\\r\\naccept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the\\r\\nday after the next was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\nElizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many\\r\\ninquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nconstruing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,\\r\\nwas pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found\\r\\nherself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the\\r\\nlast half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was\\r\\npassing, the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone,\\r\\nand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she\\r\\nstayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\\r\\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity;\\r\\nit was not their wish to force her communication.  It was evident\\r\\nthat she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they\\r\\nhad before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in\\r\\nlove with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\ninquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\nas far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they\\r\\ndrawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s\\r\\nreport, without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\nHertfordshire to which he was known would not have\\r\\nrecognized it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,\\r\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\\r\\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him\\r\\nsince he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated\\r\\nrespectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had\\r\\nanything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends\\r\\nthat could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to\\r\\naccuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\\r\\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\\r\\nmarket-town where the family did not visit.  It was\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\\r\\nmuch good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\nnot held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\nconcerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly\\r\\nunderstood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\\r\\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\r\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\nmore than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\nseemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\ntowards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole\\r\\nhours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not\\r\\nhate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had\\r\\nalmost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against\\r\\nhim, that could be so called.  The respect created by the\\r\\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly\\r\\nadmitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her\\r\\nfeeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier\\r\\nnature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing\\r\\nforward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday\\r\\nhad produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there\\r\\nwas  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be\\r\\noverlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having\\r\\nonce loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all\\r\\nthe petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and\\r\\nall the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,\\r\\nshe had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,\\r\\nseemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the\\r\\nacquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or\\r\\nany peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\\r\\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\\r\\nbent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a\\r\\nman of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\\r\\ngratitude-- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\\r\\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\\r\\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\r\\nShe respected, she esteemed, he was grateful to him, she felt a\\r\\nreal interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\r\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far\\r\\nit would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the\\r\\npower, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing\\r\\non her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\nniece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to\\r\\nsee them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she\\r\\nhad reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated,\\r\\nthough it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness\\r\\non their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly\\r\\nexpedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\r\\nThey were, therefore, to go.  Elizabeth was pleased; though\\r\\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme\\r\\nhad been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement\\r\\nmade of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before\\r\\nnoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of\\r\\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\\r\\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side\\r\\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\\r\\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\\r\\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\\r\\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and\\r\\nof the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\\r\\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\\r\\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\\r\\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana\\'s reception of them\\r\\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\\r\\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\\r\\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief\\r\\nof her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\r\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\\r\\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\\r\\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\\r\\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\\r\\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\r\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\\r\\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\\r\\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\\r\\nbeing heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\\r\\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not\\r\\nbeen seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were\\r\\nemploying her.  She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\\r\\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\r\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\r\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\\r\\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\\r\\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\\r\\nthe entrance of the servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\\r\\nof all the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a\\r\\nvariety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take\\r\\nplace till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\r\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her\\r\\npost.  There was now employment for the whole party-- for\\r\\nthough they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\r\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon\\r\\ncollected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\\r\\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\\r\\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\\r\\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\\r\\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\\r\\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\\r\\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\\r\\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\\r\\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\\r\\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\\r\\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\\r\\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\\r\\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\\r\\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\\r\\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself\\r\\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that she was anxious for\\r\\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\\r\\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\\r\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\\r\\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from\\r\\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name;\\r\\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\\r\\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\\r\\ngave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\\r\\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\\r\\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\\r\\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\\r\\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\\r\\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley know what\\r\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\\r\\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\\r\\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\\r\\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\\r\\nwhich might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to\\r\\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some\\r\\npart of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\\r\\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated\\r\\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\r\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s\\r\\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\\r\\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\\r\\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\\r\\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\\r\\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\\r\\n that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\\r\\nof his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\\r\\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\\r\\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her\\r\\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\\r\\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been\\r\\ndesigned to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\r\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\\r\\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\\r\\non Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\\r\\nwould not join her.  Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough\\r\\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had\\r\\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\\r\\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\r\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\r\\n repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\\r\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\\r\\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\\r\\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never\\r\\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\\r\\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\\r\\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character-- there is nothing marked\\r\\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\\r\\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\\r\\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\\r\\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\\r\\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is\\r\\nintolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\\r\\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\\r\\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\\r\\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\\r\\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\\r\\nhim speak, she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\\r\\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\ndining at Netherfield, \\'SHE a beauty!  I should as soon call her\\r\\nmother a wit.\\'  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\\r\\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but\\r\\nTHAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\\r\\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\\r\\nmy acquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\npain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned,\\r\\nexcept what had particularly interested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they had\\r\\nseen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked\\r\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit-- of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing\\r\\nto know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified\\r\\nby her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival\\r\\nat Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now\\r\\nbeen spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of\\r\\ntwo letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\\r\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to\\r\\nenjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.  The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\r\\nwritten five days ago.  The beginning contained an account of\\r\\nall their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\ncountry afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\nlater, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\nintelligence.  It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\nalarming you-- be assured that we are all well.  What I have to\\r\\nsay relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night,\\r\\n just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to\\r\\ninform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his\\r\\nofficers; to own the truth, with Wickham!  Imagine our surprise.\\r\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I\\r\\nam very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I\\r\\nam willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\\r\\nmisunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe\\r\\nhim, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad\\r\\nat heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know\\r\\nmy father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly\\r\\ngrieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I that we\\r\\nnever let them know what has been said against him!  we must\\r\\nforget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve,\\r\\nas is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\r\\neight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they\\r\\nmust have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives\\r\\nus reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his\\r\\nwife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I\\r\\ncannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not\\r\\nbe able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly\\r\\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read\\r\\nas follows:  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\nletter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\nconfined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\nfor being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor\\r\\nLydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken\\r\\nplace, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\r\\nto Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left\\r\\nBrighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\r\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand\\r\\nthat they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped\\r\\nby Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go\\r\\nthere, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel\\r\\nF., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to\\r\\ntrace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no\\r\\nfurther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\r\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\r\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue\\r\\nthe London road.  I know not what to think.  After making\\r\\nevery possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\\r\\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,\\r\\nand at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--\\r\\nno such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest\\r\\nconcern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\r\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely\\r\\ngrieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame\\r\\non them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father\\r\\nand mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\r\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be\\r\\nmarried privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even\\r\\nif HE could form such a design against a young woman of\\r\\nLydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so\\r\\nlost to everything?  Impossible!  I grieve to find, however, that\\r\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\nshook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W.\\r\\nwas not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\nkeeps her room.  Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\nthis is not to be expected.  And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\nlife saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\nconcealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\none cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\r\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but\\r\\nnow, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your\\r\\nreturn?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\ninconvenient.  Adieu!  I take up my pen again to do what I\\r\\nhave just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that\\r\\nI cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\npossible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\nask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do\\r\\nI am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\\r\\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\\r\\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  In such and exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance\\r\\nwould be everything in the world; he will immediately\\r\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from\\r\\nher seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\nwithout losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\nreached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\nappeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,\\r\\nand before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose\\r\\nmind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily\\r\\nexclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must\\r\\nfind Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\\r\\ndelayed; I have not an instant to loose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling\\r\\nthan politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you\\r\\na minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\nfelt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him,\\r\\nthough in so breathless an accent as made her almost\\r\\nunintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\\r\\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\\r\\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of\\r\\ngentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.  Is\\r\\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief?  A\\r\\nglass of wine; shall I get you one?  You are very ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n \"There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well; I am\\r\\nonly distressed by some dreadful news which I have just\\r\\nreceived from Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\ncould not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense,\\r\\ncould only say something indistinctly of his concern, and\\r\\nobserve her in compassionate silence.  At length she spoke\\r\\nagain.  \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful\\r\\nnews. It cannot be concealed from any one.  My younger sister\\r\\nhas left all her friends-- has eloped; has thrown herself into the\\r\\npower of-- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from\\r\\nBrighton.  YOU know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has\\r\\nno money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to-- she\\r\\nis lost for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.  \"When I consider,\" she added\\r\\nin a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\r\\nI, who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of\\r\\nit only-- some part of what I learnt, to my own family!  Had his\\r\\ncharacter been known, this could not have happened.  But it is\\r\\nall-- all too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved-- shocked.  But is\\r\\nit certain-- absolutely certain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and\\r\\nwere traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\\r\\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\nuncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour.  But nothing can be done-- I know very well that\\r\\nnothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?\\r\\nHow are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest\\r\\nhope.  It is every way horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character-- Oh! had I\\r\\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!  But I knew not-- I\\r\\nwas afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and\\r\\nwas walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his\\r\\nbrow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\ninstantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; everything\\r\\nMUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an\\r\\nassurance of the deepest disgrace.  She could neither wonder\\r\\nnor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\r\\nto her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her\\r\\ndistress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her\\r\\nunderstand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt\\r\\nthat she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\\r\\nvain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.  Lydia--\\r\\nthe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon\\r\\nswallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her\\r\\nhandkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,\\r\\nafter a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of\\r\\nher situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner\\r\\nwhich, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,\\r\\nsaid, \"I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor\\r\\nhave I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though\\r\\nunavailing concern.  Would to Heaven that anything could be\\r\\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\r\\nsuch distress!  But I will not torment you with vain wishes,\\r\\nwhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This\\r\\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.  Say\\r\\nthat urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the\\r\\nunhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his\\r\\nsorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\\r\\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\\r\\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\\r\\nlook went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was\\r\\nthat they should ever see each other again on such terms of\\r\\ncordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;\\r\\nand as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\nacquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\nthe perverseness of those feelings which would now have\\r\\npromoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in\\r\\nits termination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\nfaulty.  But if otherwise-- if regard springing from such sources\\r\\nis unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\ndescribed as arising on a first interview with its object, and even\\r\\nbefore two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\nher defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\nlatter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\nsuccess might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\ninteresting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him\\r\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy\\r\\nmust produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\nwretched business.  Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter,\\r\\nhad she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\r\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\nexpectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\ndevelopment.  While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\nher mind, she was all surprise-- all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\nshould marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible.  But no it was all too natural. For\\r\\nsuch an attachment as this she might have sufficient charm; and\\r\\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in\\r\\nan elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\nunderstanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\\r\\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was\\r\\nconvinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach\\r\\nherself to anybody.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another,\\r\\nhad been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her\\r\\nopinion.  Her affections had continually been fluctuating but\\r\\nnever without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken\\r\\nindulgence towards such a girl-- oh! how acutely did she now\\r\\nfeel it!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wild to be at home-- to hear, to see, to be upon the\\r\\nspot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly\\r\\nupon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\\r\\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and\\r\\nthough almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,\\r\\nher uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and\\r\\ntill he entered the room her impatience was severe.  Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the\\r\\nservant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\r\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated\\r\\nthe cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and\\r\\ndwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,\\r\\nthough Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.  Not Lydia\\r\\nonly, but all were concerned in it; and after the first\\r\\nexclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised\\r\\nevery assistance in his power.  Elizabeth, though expecting no\\r\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being\\r\\nactuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was\\r\\nspeedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  \"But\\r\\nwhat is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it\\r\\nso?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\nengagement.  THAT is all settled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\nroom to prepare.  \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\ndisclose the real truth?  Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\nin the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth\\r\\nbeen at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\nall employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself;\\r\\nbut she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and\\r\\namongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their\\r\\nfriends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden\\r\\ndeparture.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and\\r\\nMr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,\\r\\nnothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all\\r\\nthe misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of\\r\\ntime than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and\\r\\non the road to Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle,\\r\\nas they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious\\r\\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\\r\\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\\r\\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\\r\\nwas actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\\r\\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\\r\\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\\r\\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your\\r\\nuncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think so\\r\\nvery ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\\r\\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\nBut I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland\\r\\nif that had been the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute\\r\\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\nfound on the Barnet road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then-- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\\r\\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\\r\\nthan in Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\\r\\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no-- this is not likely.  His\\r\\nmost particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was\\r\\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\\r\\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\\r\\nit.  And what claims has Lydia-- what attraction has she beyond\\r\\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\\r\\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\\r\\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\\r\\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\\r\\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\\r\\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\\r\\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\\r\\nand he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his\\r\\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to\\r\\nwhat was going forward in his family, that HE would do as\\r\\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such\\r\\na matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and\\r\\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I\\r\\nknow not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But\\r\\nshe is very young; she has never been taught to think on\\r\\nserious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth-- she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\r\\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\\r\\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\\r\\ncame in her way.  Since the  ----shire were first quartered in\\r\\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in\\r\\nher head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\\r\\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater-- what shall\\r\\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\nenough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\r\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very\\r\\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\\r\\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\\r\\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\\r\\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\\r\\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\nas he is insinuating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring.  \"I told you, the\\r\\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\\r\\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\\r\\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\\r\\nI am not at liberty-- which it is not worth while to relate; but his\\r\\nlies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\\r\\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\r\\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\\r\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\\r\\nhave found her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\\r\\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\nsaw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\\r\\nreturned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\nfortnight\\'s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\nrelated the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\\r\\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\\r\\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\r\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could\\r\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\r\\nThat such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily\\r\\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\\r\\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near\\r\\nMeryton was out of her senses about him for the first two\\r\\nmonths; but he never distinguished HER by any particular\\r\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\\r\\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,\\r\\nand others of the regiment, who treated her with more\\r\\ndistinction, again became her favourites.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\\r\\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\\r\\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\\r\\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\\r\\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\\r\\nforgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\\r\\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\\r\\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\\r\\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\\r\\nearnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\ndown from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\\r\\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\\r\\nhad been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane.  \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\nhope everything will be well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\\r\\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\\r\\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\\r\\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\nimportance to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my mother-- how is she?  How are you all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\r\\nMary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you-- how are you?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"You look pale.\\r\\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were engaged with their children,. Was now put an end\\r\\nto by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\naunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\\r\\nsmiles and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\ngive.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\\r\\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\\r\\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\\r\\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\\r\\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\\r\\ntheir marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might\\r\\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\\r\\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\\r\\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\\r\\ndaughter must principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to\\r\\nBrighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened;\\r\\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\\r\\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\\r\\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\r\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\\r\\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And now\\r\\nhere\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\nLydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\\r\\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\\r\\non it a certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\r\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\\r\\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\\r\\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\\r\\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\\r\\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\\r\\nto what is to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly\\r\\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\\r\\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not\\r\\nmarried already, MAKE them marry.  And as for wedding\\r\\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall\\r\\nhave as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\\r\\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\r\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\\r\\nof my wits-- and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\\r\\nover me-- such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\\r\\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\r\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her\\r\\nclothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are\\r\\nthe best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know\\r\\nyou will contrive it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending\\r\\nmoderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after\\r\\ntalking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they\\r\\nall left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who\\r\\nattended in the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\\r\\nwaited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the\\r\\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\\r\\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\\r\\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\\r\\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\\r\\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\\r\\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\\r\\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\\r\\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\\r\\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\\r\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\\r\\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\\r\\ntable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\\r\\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\\r\\nconsolation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\nadded, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\\r\\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that\\r\\nshe cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\nundeserving of the other sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\\r\\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil\\r\\nbefore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\\r\\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\\r\\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\nsubject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\r\\nI have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.  What did\\r\\nColonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\nbefore the elopement took place?  They must have seen them\\r\\ntogether for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\npartiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any\\r\\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\\r\\nkind to the utmost.  He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us\\r\\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\\r\\nScotland:  when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\nhis journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\r\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\\r\\nseen Denny himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing\\r\\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\nmarrying-- and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\\r\\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\r\\nI felt a little uneasy-- a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with\\r\\nhim in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\\r\\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\\r\\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\\r\\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\\r\\nrest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for\\r\\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\\r\\neach other, many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\\r\\nhimself?  Does he know he real character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left\\r\\nMeryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\\r\\nof him, this could not have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.  \"But to\\r\\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\\r\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\\r\\nthe best intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to\\r\\nhis wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\nThese were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,--\\r\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\\r\\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\\r\\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\\r\\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\\r\\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\\r\\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\\r\\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write\\r\\nto them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\'  What a good joke\\r\\nit will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my\\r\\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\\r\\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\\r\\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we\\r\\nmeet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I\\r\\nget to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\\r\\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\r\\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\\r\\ndrink to our good journey.  Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n                              \"Lydia Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\nhad finished it.  What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\nmoment!  But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the\\r\\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\\r\\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of\\r\\ninfamy.  My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word\\r\\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and\\r\\nthe whole house in such confusion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\\r\\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\nendeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\\r\\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\\r\\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\\r\\nmy faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\\r\\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had every\\r\\ncare and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of\\r\\nthem.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\\r\\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\\r\\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\\r\\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\\r\\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\r\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\\r\\ndaughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps\\r\\nshe MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\ncannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.  Assistance is\\r\\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\\r\\nat a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\\r\\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of\\r\\nhis daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\\r\\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\\r\\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from\\r\\nLondon; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\r\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another\\r\\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.  If\\r\\nhe could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had\\r\\nbefore set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there,\\r\\nand hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and\\r\\nnumber of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that\\r\\nhe had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his\\r\\nspirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\r\\nout even so much as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\\r\\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\\r\\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they\\r\\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\\r\\nonly for the letters before he set off.\\r\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s\\r\\nnot being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\\r\\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\nthem up-- though, as she never came without reporting some\\r\\nfresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she\\r\\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\\r\\nshe found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\\r\\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\\r\\nintrigues all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\\r\\nextended into every tradesman\\'s family.  Everybody declared\\r\\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\r\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted\\r\\nthe appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not\\r\\ncredit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\\r\\nher former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even\\r\\nJane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\\r\\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\\r\\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they\\r\\nmust in all probability have gained some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\nhad immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\\r\\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\\r\\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\\r\\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\\r\\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\r\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\\r\\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\r\\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\\r\\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\\r\\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\\r\\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\\r\\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the\\r\\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\\r\\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\\r\\nconcealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply\\r\\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\\r\\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\\r\\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\\r\\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\r\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\\r\\nany other person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\\r\\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\\r\\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\\r\\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\\r\\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\\r\\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\\r\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more\\r\\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\r\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\\r\\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s\\r\\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be\\r\\ntold would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\\r\\nexpected to bring some news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\\r\\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\\r\\nand read it likewise. It was s follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--\\r\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\\r\\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\r\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\r\\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\\r\\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\nrespectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\nthe bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no\\r\\n time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part\\r\\nthat can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- or that may comfort\\r\\nyou, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most\\r\\nafflicting to a parent\\'s mind.  The death of your daughter would\\r\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of  this.  And it is the more\\r\\nto be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear\\r\\nCharlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in\\r\\nyour daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\nthough, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition\\r\\nmust be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an\\r\\nenormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are\\r\\ngrievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by\\r\\nMrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter,\\r\\nto whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in\\r\\napprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\\r\\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\\r\\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\\r\\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\\r\\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\r\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you, dear\\r\\nsir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your\\r\\nunworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\r\\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.-- I am, dear sir, etc.,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\ncertain that he had no  near one living.  His former\\r\\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\r\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\\r\\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\\r\\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in\\r\\nthe wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\\r\\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\\r\\nby Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left\\r\\ngaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\r\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\\r\\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\r\\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\\r\\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\\r\\nhorror.  \"A gamester!\" she cried.  \"This is wholly unexpected.\\r\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\\r\\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return\\r\\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\\r\\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\\r\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\\r\\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\\r\\nlife had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried.\\r\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\\r\\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes\\r\\naway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\\r\\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\\r\\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\\r\\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\nLongbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\\r\\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\\r\\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\\r\\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\\r\\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\\r\\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\\r\\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\\r\\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though\\r\\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\\r\\nher own feelings, was perfectly  aware that, had she known\\r\\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s\\r\\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\\r\\none sleepless night out of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\ncourage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\\r\\nendured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\\r\\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\\r\\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel\\r\\nhow much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\\r\\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence\\r\\nthere will probably be of some duration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to\\r\\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\ngreatness of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\nmother\\'s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such\\r\\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\\r\\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\\r\\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\\r\\nKitty runs away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully.  \"If I\\r\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\\r\\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\nin a rational manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\\r\\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\nat the end of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\\r\\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\\r\\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\\r\\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\\r\\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for\\r\\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\r\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\r\\nGardiner?  He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\\r\\na letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\non the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when\\r\\nthey were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking\\r\\ntowards the little copse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\\r\\nof the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\\r\\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, what news-- what news?  Have you heard from my\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring-- good or bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\\r\\nletter from his pocket.  \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what\\r\\nit is about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                    \"Gracechurch Street, Monday,\"\\r\\n                              \"August 2.\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--\\r\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\\r\\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\r\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\\r\\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\\r\\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\r\\nI have seen them both-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\r\\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\\r\\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\r\\nequal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall send\\r\\nthis by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your\\r\\nanswer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\\r\\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\\r\\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\\r\\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\\r\\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be\\r\\nthe case, you send me full powers to act in your name\\r\\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\\r\\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\r\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\\r\\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\\r\\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\\r\\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\\r\\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\r\\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  \"Can it\\r\\nbe possible that he will marry her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said\\r\\nher sister.  \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\\r\\nbefore he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\\r\\nimmediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such\\r\\na case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose,\\r\\nmust be complied with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they MUST marry!  Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\\r\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\\r\\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\\r\\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money!  My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\\r\\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\\r\\nfifty after I am gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred\\r\\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\nremain!  Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings!  Generous, good\\r\\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\\r\\nnot do all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\\r\\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\\r\\nsum to be repaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\\r\\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon\\r\\nas they were by themselves.  \"How strange this is!  And for\\r\\nTHIS we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\\r\\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\\r\\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly\\r\\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\r\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\\r\\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\\r\\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\\r\\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\ncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\ngratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is\\r\\nactually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\\r\\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\\r\\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\\r\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\\r\\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come\\r\\nto a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady\\r\\nthem; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in\\r\\nso rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence\\r\\nforgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither\\r\\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\\r\\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\nnot wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing and,\\r\\nwithout raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\\r\\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s  being soon married, her joy\\r\\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\r\\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\\r\\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\r\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\\r\\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\\r\\nremembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried.  \"This is delightful indeed!\\r\\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married at\\r\\nsixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\\r\\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\r\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\\r\\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\\r\\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\\r\\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\\r\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a\\r\\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\\r\\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a\\r\\ndaughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\\r\\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\\r\\nflutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you\\r\\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\nand cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\\r\\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\\r\\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\\r\\nconsulted.  One day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small\\r\\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\\r\\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\\r\\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\\r\\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\\r\\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\r\\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\\r\\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\\r\\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\\r\\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\\r\\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\nwas no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and\\r\\nthough, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\\r\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\\r\\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one\\r\\nof the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\\r\\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\nsoon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\\r\\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be\\r\\nof age, and the widow and younger children would by that\\r\\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\\r\\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\\r\\nyears after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\\r\\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\nsaving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their\\r\\nexceeding their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\\r\\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\\r\\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\\r\\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\r\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\r\\nengagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\\r\\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\\r\\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\\r\\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\\r\\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\\r\\nmother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\r\\nthat sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\\r\\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\\r\\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\\r\\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\\r\\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have\\r\\nbeen more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\\r\\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\\r\\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.  But\\r\\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\r\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\\r\\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little\\r\\nof their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\\r\\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\ndamp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\\r\\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\\r\\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\\r\\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\\r\\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\\r\\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\\r\\ndaughter, and, without knowing of considering what their\\r\\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--\\r\\nor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\nbut Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\nmiles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\\r\\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\\r\\nto her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\\r\\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\r\\nInto ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\nreceiving them at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\\r\\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\\r\\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\\r\\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\\r\\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\r\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\\r\\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\\r\\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\\r\\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than\\r\\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\\r\\nfortnight before they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\\r\\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\\r\\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\\r\\nwho were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\r\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\\r\\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\\r\\nwhose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her\\r\\nso much-- not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\\r\\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\\r\\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\r\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\\r\\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an\\r\\nalliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom\\r\\nhe so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would\\r\\nshrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had\\r\\nassured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational\\r\\nexpectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she\\r\\nwas grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\r\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer\\r\\nhope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when\\r\\nthere seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.  She was\\r\\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it\\r\\nwas no longer likely they should meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\\r\\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\\r\\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\\r\\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\\r\\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\\r\\ntriumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\\r\\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\\r\\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to\\r\\nthe advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might\\r\\nhave been softened, his manners improved; and from his\\r\\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\r\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\\r\\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\\r\\ndifferent tendency ,and precluding the possibility of the other,\\r\\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\\r\\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\\r\\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than their\\r\\nvirtue, she could easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\r\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\nmilitia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as\\r\\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\\r\\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\\r\\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.  It is Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his\\r\\nformer friends, there are still some who are able and willing to\\r\\nassist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in\\r\\nGeneral ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an\\r\\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.  He\\r\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they\\r\\nmay each have a character to preserve, they will both be more\\r\\nprudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our\\r\\npresent arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\\r\\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\\r\\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\r\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar\\r\\nassurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a\\r\\nlist according to his information?  He has given in all his debts; I\\r\\nhope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our\\r\\ndirections, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then\\r\\njoin his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and\\r\\nI understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous\\r\\nof seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She is well, and\\r\\nbegs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--\\r\\nYours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"E. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\\r\\nWickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\r\\nGardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\\r\\nwith it.  Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had\\r\\nexpected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had\\r\\nby no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nwas a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity\\r\\nthat Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\\r\\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, \"said she, \"it will be quite\\r\\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\\r\\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\\r\\npleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\r\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\\r\\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\\r\\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\\r\\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\\r\\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married\\r\\ndaughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\r\\nNorth.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\nhe sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\nas soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\nLongbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham\\r\\nshould consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only\\r\\nher own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the\\r\\nlast object of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\\r\\nwas sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\\r\\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\\r\\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\\r\\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\\r\\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\\r\\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\\r\\nof their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,\\r\\nwas not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in\\r\\nausterity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy\\r\\nassurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke\\r\\nhim.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\\r\\nshocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,\\r\\nnoisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,\\r\\ndemanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\\r\\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\\r\\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it\\r\\nwas a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\\r\\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\\r\\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\\r\\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\r\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\\r\\nvariation of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\\r\\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\nsit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\\r\\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\\r\\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\\r\\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\\r\\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\\r\\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\\r\\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\\r\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\\r\\ntill I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good\\r\\nfun if I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\nany thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n\"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married\\r\\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\\r\\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\\r\\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\\r\\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\\r\\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\\r\\nany thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\\r\\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\\r\\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\\r\\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\\r\\nmother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\\r\\n\"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\\r\\nbecause I am a married woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\nhear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and in the\\r\\nmean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of\\r\\nbeing married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\nbreakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\\r\\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\\r\\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\\r\\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\\r\\nis, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\\r\\nLydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.  Must it\\r\\nbe so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\\r\\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\\r\\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\\r\\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\\r\\ngood partners for them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\\r\\nthem before the winter is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\r\\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\\r\\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\\r\\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\\r\\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.  She had\\r\\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\\r\\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\\r\\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\\r\\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\\r\\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\\r\\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\r\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an\\r\\nopportunity of having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\r\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\\r\\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\\r\\nlittle said on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\\r\\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s\\r\\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\\r\\nshould all be there by eleven o\\'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I\\r\\nwere to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\\r\\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\r\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\\r\\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\\r\\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\\r\\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\\r\\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\\r\\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\\r\\nbe married in his blue coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\\r\\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\\r\\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\\r\\nwas with them.  If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my\\r\\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\\r\\nparty, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather\\r\\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\\r\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\\r\\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\\r\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\r\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\\r\\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\\r\\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\\r\\nin ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.  However, I\\r\\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\\r\\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\\r\\nas well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But\\r\\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\\r\\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\\r\\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\\r\\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\\r\\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\\r\\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\\r\\nout of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad been at her sister\\'s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\\r\\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\\r\\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\\r\\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\\r\\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\\r\\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\\r\\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\\r\\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\r\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\\r\\nhad been intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity\\r\\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let\\r\\nme understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to\\r\\nremain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and\\r\\nthen I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I shall, though,\" she added to herself, as she\\r\\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\\r\\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\\r\\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\nglad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would\\r\\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\\r\\nconfidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\\r\\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\\r\\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\\r\\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\\r\\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR NIECE,\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\\r\\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\\r\\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\\r\\nyou.  Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\\r\\nyou know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary\\r\\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\\r\\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --\\r\\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\r\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are\\r\\nreally innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the\\r\\nvery day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\\r\\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\\r\\nwith him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so\\r\\nmy curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to\\r\\nhave been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out\\r\\nwhere your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen\\r\\nand talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\r\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\r\\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\r\\nthem.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being\\r\\nowing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so\\r\\nwell known as to make it impossible for any young woman of\\r\\ncharacter to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the\\r\\nwhole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\\r\\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the\\r\\nworld.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,\\r\\ntherefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an\\r\\nevil which had been brought on by himself.  If he had\\r\\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He\\r\\nhad been some days in town, before he was able to discover\\r\\nthem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more\\r\\nthan we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason\\r\\nfor his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a\\r\\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and\\r\\nwas dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,\\r\\nthough he did not say what.  She then took a large house in\\r\\nEdward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\r\\nlodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\\r\\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\\r\\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he\\r\\ncould get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her\\r\\ntrust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she\\r\\nreally did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham\\r\\nindeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and\\r\\nhad she been able to receive them into her house, they would\\r\\nhave taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our\\r\\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in\\r\\n---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\\r\\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\\r\\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and\\r\\nreturn to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to\\r\\nreceive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\r\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she\\r\\nwas.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of\\r\\nhis; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they\\r\\nshould be married some time or other, and it did not much\\r\\nsignify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,\\r\\nhe thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\\r\\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had\\r\\nnever been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave\\r\\nthe regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\\r\\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences\\r\\nof Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign\\r\\nhis commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\\r\\ncould conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,\\r\\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing\\r\\nto live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\\r\\nsister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very\\r\\nrich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his\\r\\nsituation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,\\r\\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\\r\\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some\\r\\nother country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not\\r\\nlikely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\nThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\nwas reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled\\r\\nbetween them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle\\r\\nacquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street\\r\\nthe evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\r\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father\\r\\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He\\r\\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so\\r\\nproperly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\\r\\nseeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not\\r\\nleave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a\\r\\ngentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.\\r\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said\\r\\nbefore, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again\\r\\non Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all settled\\r\\nbefore Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\r\\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,\\r\\nLizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\nafter all.  He has been accused of many faults at different\\r\\ntimes, but this is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that\\r\\nhe did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it\\r\\nto be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\\r\\nwould most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it\\r\\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the\\r\\ngentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\\r\\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be\\r\\nof use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the\\r\\nprobable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and\\r\\nI really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\npleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\nof his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\nmost.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\\r\\nthe young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\r\\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\r\\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his\\r\\ncommission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done\\r\\nby him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to\\r\\nhim, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\r\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently\\r\\nthat he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there\\r\\nwas some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,\\r\\nor anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But\\r\\nin spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest\\r\\nperfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if\\r\\nwe had not given him credit for another interest in the\\r\\naffair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to\\r\\nhis friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was\\r\\nagreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding\\r\\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\\r\\nfinish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a\\r\\nrelation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;\\r\\nI hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\r\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the\\r\\nhouse.  He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in\\r\\nHertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\r\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I\\r\\nhad not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her\\r\\nconduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and\\r\\ntherefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\r\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\r\\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done,\\r\\nand all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she\\r\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\nlisten.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected\\r\\nmy dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience\\r\\nwith her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia\\r\\ninformed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next\\r\\nday, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\r\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this\\r\\nopportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say\\r\\nbefore) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every\\r\\nrespect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\r\\na little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently,\\r\\nhis wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly\\r\\never mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray\\r\\nforgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\r\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be\\r\\nquite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low\\r\\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\\r\\nthing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been\\r\\nwanting me this half hour.  Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nM. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\\r\\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\\r\\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\\r\\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\\r\\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match,\\r\\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\\r\\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\r\\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\\r\\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\\r\\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\\r\\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\\r\\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\\r\\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\\r\\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\\r\\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\r\\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\\r\\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\\r\\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\\r\\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\\r\\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\\r\\n-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to\\r\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\nrelationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every\\r\\nkind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be\\r\\nsure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he\\r\\nhad given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\r\\nextraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he\\r\\nshould feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had\\r\\nthe means of exercising it; and though she would not place\\r\\nherself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,\\r\\nbelieve that remaining partiality for her might assist his\\r\\nendeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\r\\nmaterially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to\\r\\nknow that they were under obligations to a person who could\\r\\nnever receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\nher character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she\\r\\ngrieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\nevery saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For\\r\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that\\r\\nin a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\\r\\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt\\'s commendation\\r\\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\\r\\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\\r\\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\\r\\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\\r\\nMr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\\r\\none\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\\r\\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\r\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not\\r\\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\\r\\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  Are the others coming out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\\r\\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\\r\\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\\r\\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\\r\\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\\r\\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\\r\\ndid not mention my name to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\r\\n-- not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\\r\\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\\r\\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\\r\\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"It must be something particular, to take him there\\r\\nat this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\\r\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\\r\\nout well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\nhad.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House!\\r\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\\r\\nnot to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a\\r\\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\\r\\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\\r\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\\r\\nin Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\\r\\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\npresent patron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\\r\\nfrom the first, you may remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\\r\\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\\r\\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\\r\\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\\r\\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she\\r\\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\\r\\nsister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\\r\\na good-humoured smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\r\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\\r\\nshall be always of one mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\\r\\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\\r\\nentered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\nthat he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\nsister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\npleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by\\r\\nno means entered into her scheme of their all going to\\r\\nNewcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  I don\\'t know.  Not these two or three years,\\r\\nperhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much\\r\\ntime for writing.  My sisters may write to me.  They will\\r\\nhave nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his\\r\\nwife\\'s.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\nout of the house, \"as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\nmakes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy\\r\\neven Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\r\\nson-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\\r\\nseveral days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\nparting with one\\'s friends.  One seems so forlorn without\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying\\r\\na daughter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It must make you better\\r\\nsatisfied that your other four are single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\nmarried, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be\\r\\nso far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\\r\\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\\r\\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be\\r\\nin circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received\\r\\norders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming\\r\\ndown in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and\\r\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\\r\\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  \"Well, so\\r\\nmuch the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is\\r\\nnothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to\\r\\nsee him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\r\\nNetherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what may\\r\\nhappen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we\\r\\nagreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,\\r\\nis it quite certain he is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls\\r\\nwas in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out\\r\\nmyself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that\\r\\nit was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,\\r\\nvery likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher\\'s, she\\r\\ntold me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she\\r\\nhas got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\nchanging colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned\\r\\nhis name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone\\r\\ntogether, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of\\r\\nthe present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But\\r\\ndon\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused\\r\\nfor the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\\r\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with\\r\\npleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\\r\\nbecause we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of\\r\\nmyself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen\\r\\nhim in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of\\r\\ncoming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but\\r\\nshe still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to\\r\\nthe greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s\\r\\npermission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man\\r\\ncannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\nraising all this speculation!  I will leave him to himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\nher feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\neasily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They\\r\\nwere more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"you will wait on him of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and\\r\\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my\\r\\ndaughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on\\r\\na fool\\'s errand again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\nattention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he.  \"If he wants our\\r\\nsociety, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not\\r\\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\ngo away and come back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\nnot wait on him.  But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking\\r\\nhim to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and\\r\\nthe Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so\\r\\nthere will be just room at table for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\\r\\nher husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know\\r\\nthat her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence\\r\\nof it, before they did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\\r\\nsister.  \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\ntalked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\ncan know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I\\r\\nbe, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel\\r\\nit; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a\\r\\nsufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\nservants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that\\r\\nthe period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as\\r\\nlong as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene\\r\\nbefore their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him\\r\\nbefore.  But on the third morning after his arrival in\\r\\nHertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\r\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane\\r\\nresolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to\\r\\nsatisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she\\r\\nsaw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I\\r\\ndo not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\\r\\nbe with him before.  Mr. what\\'s-his-name.  That tall, proud\\r\\nman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well,\\r\\nany friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be\\r\\nsure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew\\r\\nbut little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt\\r\\nfor the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him\\r\\nalmost for the first time after receiving his explanatory\\r\\nletter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for\\r\\nthe other, and of course for themselves; and their mother\\r\\ntalked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\\r\\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being\\r\\nheard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of\\r\\nuneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she\\r\\nhad never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to\\r\\nrelate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he\\r\\ncould be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose\\r\\nmerit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\r\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were\\r\\nindebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded\\r\\nherself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as\\r\\nreasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her\\r\\nastonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\nLongbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal\\r\\nto what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour\\r\\nin Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for\\r\\nhalf a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight\\r\\nadded lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time\\r\\nthat his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she\\r\\nwould not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be\\r\\nearly enough for expectation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\ndaring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\nto the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\ndoor.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate\\r\\nthan Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her\\r\\ncolour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,\\r\\nand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom\\r\\nof resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\nsat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\noften command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He\\r\\nlooked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\nPemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence\\r\\nbe what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,\\r\\nbut not an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that\\r\\nshort period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He\\r\\nwas received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which\\r\\nmade her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with\\r\\nthe cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address\\r\\nto his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\nlatter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\nquestion which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\nscarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was\\r\\nthe reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\\r\\nDerbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could\\r\\nnot to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without\\r\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\\r\\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\\r\\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and\\r\\nfrequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness\\r\\nand less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were\\r\\nplainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with\\r\\nherself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she.  \"Yet why did\\r\\nhe come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself;\\r\\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.  \"I began to be afraid you would never come back\\r\\nagain.  People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\nbut, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have\\r\\nhappened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas\\r\\nis married and settled.  And one of my own daughters.\\r\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen\\r\\nit in the papers.  It was in The Times and The Courier, I\\r\\nknow; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only\\r\\nsaid, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\'\\'\\r\\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place\\r\\nwhere she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner\\'s\\r\\ndrawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an\\r\\nawkward business of it.  Did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\ntherefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter\\r\\nwell married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time,\\r\\nMr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from\\r\\nme.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward,\\r\\nit seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\r\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his\\r\\nleaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\r\\nThank Heaven!  he has some friends, though perhaps not so\\r\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was\\r\\nin such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\r\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\\r\\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked\\r\\nBingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at\\r\\npresent.  A few weeks, he believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as\\r\\nmany as you please on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor.  I am sure he\\r\\nwill be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the\\r\\nbest of the covies for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such\\r\\nofficious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at\\r\\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was\\r\\npersuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\r\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not\\r\\nmake Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\\r\\nmore to be in company with either of them.  Their society can\\r\\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\\r\\nthis!  Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\nobserving how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\nadmiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had\\r\\nspoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\ngiving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as\\r\\nshe had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,\\r\\nthough not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no\\r\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\\r\\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was\\r\\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to\\r\\ndine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\\r\\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\\r\\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not\\r\\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed\\r\\nthat you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\nThey then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\ndine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\ntable, she did not think any thing less than two courses could\\r\\nbe good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs,\\r\\nor satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nAS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\\r\\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\\r\\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\\r\\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\\r\\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\r\\nTeazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\\r\\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\\r\\nlook, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors,\\r\\nthan Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\\r\\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\\r\\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\\r\\nin love with you as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\\r\\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\\r\\nof Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\\r\\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\\r\\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\\r\\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\\r\\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\\r\\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\\r\\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\\r\\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\\r\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\\r\\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\\r\\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\nshewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\nJane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\r\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\\r\\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\\r\\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\r\\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\\r\\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\\r\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\\r\\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\\r\\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\\r\\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\\r\\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\r\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any\\r\\nthing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\\r\\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\\r\\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\\r\\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\\r\\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\\r\\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\\r\\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\r\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\r\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give\\r\\nhim up for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\\r\\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded\\r\\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\\r\\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\\r\\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\\r\\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the\\r\\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\\r\\nnone of them; do we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\\r\\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,\\r\\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\\r\\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\\r\\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\\r\\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\\r\\nto their feelings!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\\r\\nScarborough, these three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\\r\\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,\\r\\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\\r\\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\\r\\nfall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and\\r\\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\\r\\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\\r\\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\\r\\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\\r\\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\\r\\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\\r\\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\\r\\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day?  I think every thing has\\r\\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as\\r\\nwell dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a\\r\\nturn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The\\r\\nsoup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\'\\r\\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\r\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three\\r\\nFrench cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look\\r\\nin greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her\\r\\nwhether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?\\r\\n``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\'\\'\\r\\nShe did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as\\r\\never lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and\\r\\nnot at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\nenough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\\r\\nnext day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\\r\\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\\r\\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\\r\\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\\r\\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\\r\\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\\r\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\\r\\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\\r\\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\nacknowledge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\\r\\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\\r\\nnot make me your confidante.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55\\r\\n\\r\\nA FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and\\r\\nalone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but\\r\\nwas to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an\\r\\nhour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited\\r\\nhim to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,\\r\\nhe confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\\r\\nlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if\\r\\nshe would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\nwaiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\ninvitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\\r\\nof them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in\\r\\nher dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --\\r\\nMr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.\\r\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on\\r\\nwith her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say\\r\\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs\\r\\nhalf an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,\\r\\nbe quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\ngo down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again\\r\\nin the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,\\r\\nas was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\r\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, without making any impression on them.\\r\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\\r\\nshe very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?  What do\\r\\nyou keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you.\"  She then sat\\r\\nstill five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\noccasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here,\\r\\nmy love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\\r\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her\\r\\ndistress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she\\r\\nwould not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nhalf-opened the door and called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her\\r\\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.  \"Kitty and I are going\\r\\nup stairs to sit in my dressing room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but\\r\\nremained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\\r\\nsight, then returned into the drawing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley\\r\\nwas every thing that was charming, except the professed lover\\r\\nof her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a\\r\\nmost agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore\\r\\nwith the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all\\r\\nher silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance\\r\\nparticularly grateful to the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\nwent away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own\\r\\nand Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot\\r\\nwith her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\r\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\\r\\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\\r\\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the\\r\\nstated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded\\r\\nthat all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\r\\nconcurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter\\r\\nwas much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was\\r\\nnothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke\\r\\nhis ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\ncommunicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\nhim.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\nevening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\nbody away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a\\r\\nletter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose\\r\\nsoon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to\\r\\ncards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s\\r\\nschemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was\\r\\nfinished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was\\r\\nreason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for\\r\\nher.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and\\r\\nBingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\r\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\\r\\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away\\r\\nfrom each other, would have told it all.  Their situation\\r\\nwas awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse.\\r\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on\\r\\nthe point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as\\r\\nthe other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\r\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\nwith the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much.  I do not\\r\\ndeserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every\\r\\nsentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\r\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say\\r\\nhalf that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried.  \"I would not on\\r\\nany account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow\\r\\nher to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my\\r\\nfather already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate\\r\\nwill give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I\\r\\nbear so much happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\\r\\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\nand ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had\\r\\ngiven them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\r\\ncircumspection!  of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference\\r\\nwith her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,\\r\\nI dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\nwishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and\\r\\nheartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their\\r\\nrelationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and\\r\\nthen, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he\\r\\nhad to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\r\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\\r\\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,\\r\\nbecause they had for basis the excellent understanding, and\\r\\nsuper-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity\\r\\nof feeling and taste between her and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\nin terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\nto Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\r\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly\\r\\nshewed how really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\ntheir visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\ngoodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure\\r\\nin thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt\\r\\nof your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means\\r\\nunlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will\\r\\never be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat\\r\\nyou; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\nwould be unpardonable in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife,\\r\\n\"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a\\r\\nyear, and very likely more.\"  Then addressing her daughter,\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan\\'t\\r\\nget a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nalways said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not\\r\\nbe so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw\\r\\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought\\r\\nhow likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is\\r\\nthe handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond\\r\\ncompetition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared\\r\\nfor no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest\\r\\nwith her for objects of happiness which she might in future be\\r\\nable to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\nKitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him\\r\\nan invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\\r\\naccept.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to\\r\\nbestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably\\r\\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\\r\\nsometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached\\r\\nhimself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means\\r\\nof relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling\\r\\nme that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last\\r\\nspring!  I had not believed it possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But how did he\\r\\naccount for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.  They were certainly no\\r\\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\nsince he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\nrespects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\nbrother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and\\r\\nwe shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we\\r\\nonce were to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\\r\\nI ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed,\\r\\nto see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\nNovember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\nmy being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\\r\\nof his modesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\nqualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not\\r\\nbetrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had\\r\\nthe most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\\r\\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\"\\r\\ncried Jane.  \"Oh!  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family,\\r\\nand blessed above them all!  If I could but see you as happy!\\r\\nIf there were but such another man for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so\\r\\nhappy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness,\\r\\nI never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for\\r\\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\\r\\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\nlong a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do\\r\\nthe same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family\\r\\nin the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had\\r\\nfirst run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out\\r\\nfor misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nONE morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with\\r\\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\\r\\nwere sitting together in the dining room, their attention\\r\\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\\r\\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\\r\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\r\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\r\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\\r\\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\\r\\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\\r\\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\\r\\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\r\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\r\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\\r\\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\\r\\nde Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\\r\\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight\\r\\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\\r\\nladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\\r\\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\\r\\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\\r\\nis your mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  \"She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\\r\\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\\r\\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\\r\\nbecome a part of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine\\r\\nafter a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\\r\\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\nin summer; the windows are full west.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\nand then added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\\r\\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\\r\\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\\r\\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\nvery politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,\\r\\nsaid to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\\r\\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about\\r\\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\\r\\nhermitage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\\r\\nparasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed\\r\\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\\r\\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a\\r\\nshort survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she\\r\\nlooked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: --\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\\r\\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\\r\\nmust tell you why I come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\\r\\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\\r\\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\\r\\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\\r\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\\r\\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\\r\\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\\r\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\\r\\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\\r\\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\\r\\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\\r\\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the\\r\\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\ncontradicted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\\r\\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\\r\\nthat such a report is spread abroad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\\r\\nfor it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\\r\\nladyship.  You may ask questions which I shall not\\r\\nchoose to answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\\r\\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\\r\\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\\r\\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he\\r\\nhas in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest\\r\\nconcerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\\r\\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\\r\\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\\r\\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to\\r\\nsay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\nhe will make an offer to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\\r\\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\\r\\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s.  While in\\r\\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\\r\\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\\r\\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\r\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to\\r\\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\\r\\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\\r\\ncousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\\r\\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\\r\\naunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much\\r\\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\\r\\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\r\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\\r\\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\ndespised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will\\r\\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\\r\\nof us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But the\\r\\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\\r\\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\\r\\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\\r\\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\\r\\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\\r\\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\\r\\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\\r\\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\r\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more\\r\\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\\r\\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\\r\\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\\r\\nfather\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though\\r\\nuntitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\\r\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\\r\\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The\\r\\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\r\\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\\r\\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\\r\\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\\r\\nhave been brought up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s\\r\\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  You are a gentleman\\'s daughter.  But who was your\\r\\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\\r\\nignorant of their condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your\\r\\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\\r\\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\\r\\nsay, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\nengagement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\\r\\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\\r\\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\\r\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be\\r\\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your\\r\\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\\r\\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at\\r\\nall more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me,\\r\\nwould my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow\\r\\nit on his cousin?  Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the\\r\\narguments with which you have supported this extraordinary\\r\\napplication have been as frivolous as the application was\\r\\nill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you\\r\\nthink I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\r\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in\\r\\nhis affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\\r\\nright to concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore,\\r\\nto be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\\r\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\\r\\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\\r\\nyoungest sister\\'s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\\r\\nthe young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at\\r\\nthe expence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl\\r\\nto be my nephew\\'s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of\\r\\nhis late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and\\r\\nearth! -- of what are you thinking?  Are the shades of\\r\\nPemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully\\r\\nanswered.  \"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\r\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\\r\\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\\r\\neverybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my\\r\\nsentiments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly\\r\\nunconnected with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\\r\\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\\r\\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\\r\\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n\"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\\r\\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\\r\\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\\r\\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\\r\\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern -- and\\r\\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\\r\\nscorn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\\r\\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\\r\\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\\r\\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\\r\\nI will carry my point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\\r\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\\r\\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\\r\\nseriously displeased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\\r\\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\nstairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\\r\\nagain and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was\\r\\nprodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\\r\\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\\r\\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\\r\\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\\r\\nyou, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\\r\\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\\r\\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could\\r\\nshe, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\\r\\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\\r\\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\\r\\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\\r\\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\\r\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\\r\\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\\r\\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\\r\\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\\r\\nevery body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\\r\\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\\r\\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\\r\\nLucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\\r\\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\\r\\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\\r\\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\\r\\nsome future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could\\r\\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\\r\\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\\r\\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\r\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\\r\\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\r\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\\r\\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\\r\\nmarriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal\\r\\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\r\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\\r\\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\\r\\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\\r\\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a\\r\\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\\r\\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\\r\\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\\r\\nagain to Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\\r\\ncome to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall\\r\\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\\r\\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\\r\\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\\r\\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\\r\\nteazing on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by\\r\\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\\r\\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\\r\\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\\r\\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\\r\\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\ndown.  He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\nknow its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\\r\\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\\r\\non a very important conquest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the\\r\\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to\\r\\nbe pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\\r\\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\ncontinued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\\r\\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even your\\r\\nsagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\\r\\nis from Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Mr. Collins!  and what can he have to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins\\r\\nwith congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\ndaughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your\\r\\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What\\r\\nrelates to yourself, is as follows.\"  \"Having thus offered\\r\\nyou the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\r\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\\r\\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same\\r\\nauthority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not\\r\\nlong bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\\r\\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\\r\\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\\r\\npersonages in this land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"  \"This\\r\\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\\r\\nthe heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property,\\r\\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\\r\\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\\r\\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\\r\\nwith this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\r\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\\r\\ncomes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\\r\\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\\r\\non the match with a friendly eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\\r\\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\\r\\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\\r\\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\\r\\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\\r\\nadmirable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could\\r\\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\\r\\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\nbecome apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\nthe part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\nshe termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to\\r\\ngive the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\r\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and\\r\\nnot run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly\\r\\nsanctioned.\"  \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced\\r\\nthat my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up,\\r\\nand am only concerned that their living together before the\\r\\nmarriage took place should be so generally known.  I must not,\\r\\nhowever, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from\\r\\ndeclaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\r\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an\\r\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,\\r\\nI should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly\\r\\nto forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\\r\\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\"\\r\\n\"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of\\r\\nhis letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and\\r\\nhis expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look\\r\\nas if you did not enjoy it.  You are not going to be Missish,\\r\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For\\r\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and\\r\\nlaugh at them in our turn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.  But it is\\r\\nso strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes -- that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on\\r\\nany other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect\\r\\nindifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so\\r\\ndelightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not\\r\\ngive up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\r\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\\r\\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\r\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady\\r\\nCatherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her\\r\\nconsent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\\r\\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\\r\\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\r\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\r\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\\r\\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\r\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\nas Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\nbring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\nafter Lady Catherine\\'s visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;\\r\\nand, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having\\r\\nseen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,\\r\\nBingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all\\r\\nwalking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\r\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the\\r\\nremaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,\\r\\nsoon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\r\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of\\r\\nhim to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate\\r\\nresolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\ngeneral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with\\r\\nhim alone.  Now was the moment for her resolution to be\\r\\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\ngiving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\nwounding your\\'s.  I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\nunexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known\\r\\nit, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how\\r\\ngratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family,\\r\\nI should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\nmay, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.  I did not\\r\\nthink Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first\\r\\nbetrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and,\\r\\nof course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let\\r\\nme thank you again and again, in the name of all my family,\\r\\nfor that generous compassion which induced you to take so much\\r\\ntrouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of\\r\\ndiscovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\\r\\nalone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\\r\\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\\r\\nattempt to deny.  But your family owe me nothing.  Much as\\r\\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a\\r\\nshort pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\\r\\ntrifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were\\r\\nlast April, tell me so at once.  My affections and wishes\\r\\nare unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\\r\\nsubject for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\nanxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\nimmediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\nthat her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since\\r\\nthe period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with\\r\\ngratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness\\r\\nwhich this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\r\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as\\r\\nsensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be\\r\\nsupposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his\\r\\neye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt\\r\\ndelight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she\\r\\ncould not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,\\r\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\r\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was\\r\\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\\r\\nany other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted\\r\\nfor their present good understanding to the efforts of his\\r\\naunt, who did call on him in her return through London,\\r\\nand there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and\\r\\nthe substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\\r\\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her\\r\\nladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness\\r\\nand assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist\\r\\nher endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which\\r\\nshe had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,\\r\\nits effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever\\r\\nallowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your\\r\\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\\r\\nirrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged\\r\\nit to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know\\r\\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\\r\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no\\r\\nscruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though\\r\\nyour accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises,\\r\\nmy behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest\\r\\nreproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without\\r\\nabhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\nthat evening,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The conduct of neither, if\\r\\nstrictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\nhave both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection\\r\\nof what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\nduring the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\ninexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\nshall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like\\r\\nmanner.\\'\\' Those were your words.  You know not, you can\\r\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was\\r\\nsome time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow\\r\\ntheir justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\nan impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\nfelt in such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of\\r\\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your\\r\\ncountenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could\\r\\nnot have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\\r\\nyou to accept me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections\\r\\nwill not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most\\r\\nheartily ashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.  \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\\r\\nmake you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any\\r\\ncredit to its contents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\\r\\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\\r\\nbut it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter.\\r\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\\r\\nshould dread your having the power of reading again.  I can\\r\\nremember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\\r\\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have\\r\\nboth reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they\\r\\nare not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself\\r\\nperfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\nwritten in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\\r\\nso.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the\\r\\nletter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person\\r\\nwho received it, are now so widely different from what they\\r\\nwere then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it\\r\\nought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.\\r\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\r\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\\r\\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\\r\\nwhat is much better, of innocence.  But with me, it is not\\r\\nso.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which\\r\\nought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my\\r\\nlife, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was\\r\\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my\\r\\ntemper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them\\r\\nin pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many\\r\\nyears an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though\\r\\ngood themselves (my father, particularly, all that was\\r\\nbenevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me\\r\\nto be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\\r\\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\\r\\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth\\r\\ncompared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and\\r\\ntwenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\\r\\nloveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a\\r\\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,\\r\\nI was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my\\r\\nreception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed\\r\\nyou to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally,\\r\\nI assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits\\r\\nmight often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after\\r\\nthat evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\\r\\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\\r\\nmet at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being\\r\\nnoticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no\\r\\nextraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect\\r\\nto receive more than my due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every\\r\\ncivility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\npast; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your\\r\\nill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been\\r\\nattended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves\\r\\nI can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after\\r\\nI had seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance,\\r\\nand of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which\\r\\nnaturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon\\r\\nlearnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in\\r\\nquest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,\\r\\nand that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from\\r\\nno other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\nto know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining\\r\\ntheir watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder\\r\\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.  Darcy\\r\\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given\\r\\nhim the earliest information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon\\r\\nhappen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as\\r\\nmuch.\"  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it\\r\\nhad been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\r\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long\\r\\nago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\ninterference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His\\r\\nsurprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.\\r\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\\r\\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\\r\\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\\r\\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\\r\\ndirecting his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when\\r\\nyou told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my\\r\\ninformation last spring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\nvisits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\nconviction to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence\\r\\nhad prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a\\r\\ncase, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was\\r\\nobliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not\\r\\nunjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal\\r\\nthat your sister had been in town three months last winter,\\r\\nthat I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was\\r\\nangry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than\\r\\nhe remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.  He has\\r\\nheartily forgiven me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\ndelightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\ninvaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he\\r\\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early\\r\\nto begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\\r\\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\\r\\nconversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they\\r\\nparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a\\r\\nquestion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\nentered their room, and from all the others when they sat down\\r\\nto table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\nabout, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as\\r\\nshe spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing\\r\\nextraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the\\r\\nunacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in\\r\\nwhich happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and\\r\\nconfused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself\\r\\nto be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were\\r\\nother evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in\\r\\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that\\r\\nno one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others\\r\\nit was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence\\r\\nmight do away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was\\r\\nvery far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\nincredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it\\r\\nto be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was\\r\\non you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do\\r\\nnot.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the\\r\\ntruth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.  \"Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.\\r\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.  That is all to be forgot.\\r\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in\\r\\nsuch cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is\\r\\nthe last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and\\r\\nmore seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe\\r\\nyou,\" cried Jane.  \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do\\r\\ncongratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question\\r\\n-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us\\r\\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\r\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a\\r\\nbrother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or\\r\\nmyself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\nimpossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?\\r\\nOh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.\\r\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel more than I ought to\\r\\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\r\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest sister, now be serious.  I want to talk very\\r\\nseriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\ndelay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\nbegan.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\nbeautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced\\r\\nthe desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\nassurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\nBennet had nothing farther to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as\\r\\nmyself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but\\r\\nhis love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\nBingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley\\r\\nand yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very\\r\\nsly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what\\r\\npassed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it\\r\\nto another, not to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been\\r\\nunwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her\\r\\nown feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\r\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in\\r\\nLydia\\'s marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night\\r\\nspent in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window\\r\\nthe next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming\\r\\nhere again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so\\r\\ntiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he\\r\\nwould go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\nwith his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must\\r\\nwalk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\\r\\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\\r\\nalways giving him such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\nand shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\ninformation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\nhave you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her\\r\\nway again to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,\\r\\nand Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but\\r\\nI am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\r\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed\\r\\na great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth\\r\\nsilently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have\\r\\nthat disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not\\r\\nmind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no\\r\\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do\\r\\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent\\r\\nshould be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth\\r\\nreserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.  She\\r\\ncould not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes\\r\\ndoubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough\\r\\nto overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were\\r\\nviolently set against the match, or violently delighted with\\r\\nit, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted\\r\\nto do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that\\r\\nMr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the\\r\\nfirst vehemence of her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\nshe saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation\\r\\non seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father\\'s\\r\\nopposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it\\r\\nshould be through her means -- that she, his favourite child,\\r\\nshould be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him\\r\\nwith fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched\\r\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\\r\\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his\\r\\nsmile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was\\r\\nsitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work\\r\\nsaid in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the\\r\\nlibrary.\"  She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and\\r\\nanxious.  \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are you out\\r\\nof your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always\\r\\nhated him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\\r\\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would\\r\\nhave spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\nexceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and\\r\\nshe assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to\\r\\nMr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is\\r\\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\\r\\ncarriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\\r\\nbelief of my indifference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort\\r\\nof man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes,\\r\\n\"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly\\r\\namiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not\\r\\npain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\r\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare\\r\\nrefuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it\\r\\nto you, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise\\r\\nyou to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.\\r\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless\\r\\nyou truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him\\r\\nas a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the\\r\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely\\r\\nescape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the\\r\\ngrief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\\r\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\nreply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\nreally the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual\\r\\nchange which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her\\r\\nabsolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a\\r\\nday, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and\\r\\nenumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer\\r\\nher father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no\\r\\nmore to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could\\r\\nnot have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what\\r\\nMr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  He heard her with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did\\r\\nevery thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the\\r\\nfellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!  So much the\\r\\nbetter.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\r\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid\\r\\nhim; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their\\r\\nown way.  I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant\\r\\nand storm about his love for you, and there will be an end\\r\\nof the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\nreading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\ntime, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in,\\r\\nfor I am quite at leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;\\r\\nand, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room,\\r\\nshe was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\r\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed\\r\\ntranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to\\r\\nbe dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would\\r\\ncome in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\nfollowed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect\\r\\nwas most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it\\r\\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she\\r\\nheard; though not in general backward to credit what was for\\r\\nthe advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\r\\nlover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to\\r\\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,\\r\\nand bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me!\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true?\\r\\nOh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be!\\r\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\r\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased --\\r\\nso happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! --\\r\\nOh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him\\r\\nso much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy.\\r\\nA house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three\\r\\ndaughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will\\r\\nbecome of me.  I shall go distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was\\r\\nheard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had\\r\\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\r\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!  \\'Tis as good as a\\r\\nLord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married\\r\\nby a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish\\r\\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the\\r\\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\nthe certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\nher relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\nfor.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;\\r\\nfor Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended\\r\\nson-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was\\r\\nin her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference\\r\\nfor his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\\r\\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured\\r\\nher that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall\\r\\nlike your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she\\r\\nwanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love\\r\\nwith her.  \"How could you begin?\" said she.  \"I can comprehend\\r\\nyour going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;\\r\\nbut what could set you off in the first place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\nwords, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was\\r\\nin the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --\\r\\nmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the\\r\\nuncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to\\r\\ngive you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for\\r\\nmy impertinence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very\\r\\nlittle less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of\\r\\ndeference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the\\r\\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for\\r\\nyour approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,\\r\\nbecause I was so unlike them.  Had you not been really\\r\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the\\r\\npains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\\r\\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the\\r\\npersons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved\\r\\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\\r\\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be\\r\\nsure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of\\r\\nthat when they fall in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\nshe was ill at Netherfield?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a\\r\\nvirtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your\\r\\nprotection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\nand, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing\\r\\nand quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\ndirectly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to\\r\\nthe point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first\\r\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you\\r\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\nencouragement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I\\r\\nwonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left\\r\\nto yourself.  I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had\\r\\nnot asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness\\r\\nto Lydia had certainly great effect.  Too much, I am\\r\\nafraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs\\r\\nfrom a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned\\r\\nthe subject.  This will never do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly\\r\\nfair.  Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\nwere the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted\\r\\nfor my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing\\r\\nyour gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening\\r\\nof your\\'s.  My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\ndetermined at once to know every thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make\\r\\nher happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did\\r\\nyou come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to\\r\\nLongbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more\\r\\nserious consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one,\\r\\nor what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\nstill partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\\r\\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine\\r\\nwhat is to befall her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\r\\nBut it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper,\\r\\nit shall be done directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\nonce did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with\\r\\nMr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet\\r\\nanswered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having that\\r\\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was\\r\\nalmost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost\\r\\nthree days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought\\r\\nto have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\r\\nYou supposed more than really existed.  But now suppose as\\r\\nmuch as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\nimagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\ngreatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again\\r\\nand again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly\\r\\nas to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will\\r\\ngo round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the\\r\\nworld.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one\\r\\nwith such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only\\r\\nsmiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world\\r\\nthat he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at\\r\\nChristmas.  Your\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\nand still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to\\r\\nMr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\nI must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwill soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine\\r\\nas well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the\\r\\nnephew.  He has more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his\\r\\napproaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\\r\\ninsincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\\r\\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\r\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling\\r\\nno reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder\\r\\nanswer than she knew was deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\ninformation, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\r\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her\\r\\ndelight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\ncongratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn\\r\\nfamily heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas\\r\\nlodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\r\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by\\r\\nthe contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really\\r\\nrejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\\r\\nstorm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of\\r\\nher friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in\\r\\nthe course of their meetings she must sometimes think the\\r\\npleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all\\r\\nthe parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore\\r\\nit, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to\\r\\nSir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\r\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of\\r\\ntheir all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent\\r\\ncomposure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir\\r\\nWilliam was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,\\r\\ntax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as\\r\\nher sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\nfamiliarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet,\\r\\nwhenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her\\r\\nrespect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely\\r\\nto make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to\\r\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever\\r\\nanxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with\\r\\nwhom he might converse without mortification; and though the\\r\\nuncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\\r\\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\\r\\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time\\r\\nwhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\\r\\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\\r\\nat Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nHAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which\\r\\nMrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\r\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,\\r\\nand talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,\\r\\nfor the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her\\r\\nearnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children\\r\\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\\r\\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\r\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\r\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally\\r\\nnervous and invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\\r\\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing\\r\\nelse could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially\\r\\nwhen he was least expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton\\r\\nrelations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her\\r\\naffectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then\\r\\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\\r\\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other\\r\\nsource of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\ntime with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to\\r\\nwhat she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She\\r\\nwas not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from\\r\\nthe influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper\\r\\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and\\r\\nless insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society\\r\\nshe was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\r\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\\r\\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent\\r\\nto her going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was\\r\\nobliged to mix more with the world, but she could still\\r\\nmoralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer\\r\\nmortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her\\r\\nown, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to\\r\\nthe change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\\r\\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with\\r\\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become\\r\\nacquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood\\r\\nhad before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,\\r\\nwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed\\r\\non to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which\\r\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to\\r\\nher that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a\\r\\nhope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\ndear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to\\r\\nhave you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\nyou will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\ncourt very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\nenough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of\\r\\nabout three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak\\r\\nto Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty\\r\\nand expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it\\r\\nwas in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be\\r\\ncalled economy in her own private expences, she frequently\\r\\nsent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an\\r\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so\\r\\nextravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must\\r\\nbe very insufficient to their support; and whenever they\\r\\nchanged their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of\\r\\nbeing applied to for some little assistance towards discharging\\r\\ntheir bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration\\r\\nof peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\r\\nextreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest\\r\\nof a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\r\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted\\r\\na little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she\\r\\nretained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\\r\\ngiven her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.\\r\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\\r\\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys\\r\\nthey both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s\\r\\ngood humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk\\r\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but\\r\\nas she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\nPemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever\\r\\nof Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and\\r\\npaid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were\\r\\nable to love each other even as well as they intended.\\r\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\\r\\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment\\r\\nbordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking\\r\\nto her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a\\r\\nrespect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the\\r\\nobject of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which\\r\\nhad never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take\\r\\nliberties with her husband which a brother will not always\\r\\nallow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\ncharacter in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\narrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially\\r\\nof Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\r\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on\\r\\nto overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after\\r\\na little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\r\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\\r\\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she\\r\\ncondescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that\\r\\npollution which its woods had received, not merely from the\\r\\npresence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and\\r\\naunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\\r\\nterms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and\\r\\nthey were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards\\r\\nthe persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the\\r\\nmeans of uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

Her mother had died\\r\\ntoo long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of\\r\\nher caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as\\r\\ngoverness, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a\\r\\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\\r\\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before\\r\\nMiss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the\\r\\nmildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;\\r\\nand the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been\\r\\nliving together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma\\r\\ndoing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but\\r\\ndirected chiefly by her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\\r\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\r\\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\r\\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,\\r\\nthat they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\r\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's\\r\\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\\r\\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\r\\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and\\r\\nherself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer\\r\\na long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as\\r\\nusual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\\r\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\r\\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\r\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\r\\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want\\r\\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\\r\\npast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had\\r\\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had\\r\\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\\r\\nnursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\\r\\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\\r\\nyears, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\\r\\nIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\\r\\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\\r\\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\\r\\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\\r\\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\\r\\nhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\\r\\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\\r\\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\\r\\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss\\r\\nTaylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,\\r\\nshe was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She\\r\\ndearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not\\r\\nmeet her in conversation, rational or playful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\r\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\r\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of\\r\\nmind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\\r\\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\\r\\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\\r\\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\\r\\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\\r\\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\\r\\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\\r\\nand give her pleasant society again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\r\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\\r\\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses\\r\\nwere first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\\r\\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\\r\\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even\\r\\nhalf a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over\\r\\nit, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it\\r\\nnecessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous\\r\\nman, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\\r\\nhating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the\\r\\norigin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet\\r\\nreconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her\\r\\nbut with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\r\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his\\r\\nhabits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that\\r\\nother people could feel differently from himself, he was very much\\r\\ndisposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for\\r\\nthem, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the\\r\\nrest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully\\r\\nas she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was\\r\\nimpossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\\r\\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such\\r\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\r\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\\r\\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\\r\\nown?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\r\\nThis is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my\\r\\ndear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We\\r\\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\\r\\nvisit very soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\\r\\nnot walk half so far.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\\r\\nto be sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\\r\\nlittle way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\\r\\nvisit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have\\r\\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\\r\\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\\r\\nto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only\\r\\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\\r\\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\\r\\nmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\\r\\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\\r\\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\\r\\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\\r\\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\\r\\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\\r\\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\\r\\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\\r\\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\\r\\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\\r\\nbe able to tell her how we all are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\\r\\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\r\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\\r\\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked\\r\\nin and made it unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\r\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\r\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived\\r\\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\\r\\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\\r\\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\\r\\nsome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\\r\\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\\r\\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoor Isabella\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have\\r\\nhad a shocking walk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\\r\\nmust draw back from your great fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\\r\\ncatch cold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\\r\\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\\r\\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\\r\\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\\r\\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\\r\\nall behave? Who cried most?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\\r\\n'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\\r\\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it\\r\\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEspecially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\\r\\ncreature!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma playfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is what you have in your head, I\\r\\nknow--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, with a\\r\\nsigh. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\\r\\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\\r\\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a\\r\\njoke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\\r\\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\\r\\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew\\r\\nit would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\\r\\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\\r\\nevery body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma knows I never flatter her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I meant no\\r\\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\\r\\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\\r\\ngainer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, willing to let it pass--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou want to hear about\\r\\nthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\\r\\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not\\r\\na tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we\\r\\nwere going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every\\r\\nday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Emma bears every thing so well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\\r\\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\r\\nis impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\\r\\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's\\r\\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's\\r\\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\\r\\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\\r\\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\\r\\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand a very\\r\\nconsiderable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you\\r\\nknow, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the\\r\\nright, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\\r\\ncomfort me for any thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\r\\nmy dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\\r\\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\\r\\nmatches.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\\r\\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\\r\\nsuccess, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\\r\\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\\r\\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\\r\\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\\r\\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend\\r\\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\\r\\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\\r\\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\\r\\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\\r\\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEver since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met\\r\\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\\r\\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\\r\\nFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match\\r\\nfrom that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,\\r\\ndear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not understand what you mean by 'success,'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuccess supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\\r\\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\\r\\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\\r\\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\\r\\nonly your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it\\r\\nwould be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\\r\\nher,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\\r\\ndo you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You\\r\\nmade a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I\\r\\npity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\\r\\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my\\r\\npoor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\\r\\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\\r\\nbut I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and\\r\\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\\r\\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\\r\\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\\r\\nenough to comprehend that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\r\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\r\\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\\r\\ngood to them, by interference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rejoined\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear, pray do not\\r\\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\\r\\ncircle grievously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\\r\\nElton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\\r\\nHighbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has\\r\\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him\\r\\nsingle any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,\\r\\nhe looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office\\r\\ndone for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I\\r\\nhave of doing him a service.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young\\r\\nman, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any\\r\\nattention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will\\r\\nbe a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to\\r\\nmeet him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nlaughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\\r\\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\\r\\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\\r\\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\r\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\r\\ngentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\\r\\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\\r\\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\\r\\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering\\r\\ninto the militia of his county, then embodied.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\\r\\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire\\r\\nfamily, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,\\r\\nexcept her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were\\r\\nfull of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\\r\\nfortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was\\r\\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\\r\\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with\\r\\ndue decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\\r\\nhappiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a\\r\\nhusband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due\\r\\nto her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\\r\\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\\r\\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,\\r\\nbut not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's\\r\\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\\r\\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\\r\\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\\r\\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\r\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\\r\\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\\r\\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\\r\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\\r\\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\\r\\nmother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature\\r\\nof equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the\\r\\nlittle Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance\\r\\nthe widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were\\r\\novercome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and\\r\\nthe wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,\\r\\nand his own situation to improve as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\\r\\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\\r\\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\\r\\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\\r\\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation\\r\\nand the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his\\r\\nlife passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy\\r\\ncompetence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining\\r\\nHighbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as\\r\\nportionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of\\r\\nhis own friendly and social disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\\r\\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,\\r\\nit had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\\r\\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\\r\\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\\r\\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\\r\\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\\r\\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\\r\\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\\r\\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\\r\\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\\r\\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\\r\\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\\r\\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\\r\\nuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\\r\\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,\\r\\nthat he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no\\r\\napprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her\\r\\nhusband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that\\r\\nany caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he\\r\\nbelieved, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and\\r\\nwas proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man\\r\\nhad made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as\\r\\nsufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a\\r\\nkind of common concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\r\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\r\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\\r\\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\\r\\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\\r\\ndissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with\\r\\nMrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now\\r\\nwas the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope\\r\\nstrengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new\\r\\nmother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury\\r\\nincluded some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill\\r\\nhas written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,\\r\\nindeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and\\r\\nhe says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\r\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\r\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\\r\\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\\r\\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\\r\\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\\r\\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\\r\\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\\r\\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\\r\\npain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,\\r\\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\\r\\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\\r\\nhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\\r\\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\\r\\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of\\r\\nRandalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,\\r\\nand in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the\\r\\napproaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in\\r\\nthe week together.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more\\r\\nthan satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\\r\\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\\r\\nat his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her\\r\\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\\r\\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\\r\\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,\\r\\nand saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to\\r\\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\\r\\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\\r\\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\\r\\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach\\r\\ncould bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\\r\\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit\\r\\nfor any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them\\r\\nfrom having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\\r\\nearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the\\r\\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry\\r\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\r\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he\\r\\ncould not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\\r\\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\\r\\nmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\\r\\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\\r\\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\\r\\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\\r\\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\\r\\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\\r\\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\\r\\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his\\r\\nown little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\\r\\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\\r\\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but\\r\\nsuch as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury,\\r\\nincluding Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish\\r\\nadjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not\\r\\nunfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and\\r\\nthe best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred;\\r\\nand, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there\\r\\nwas scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a\\r\\ncard-table for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by\\r\\nMr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\\r\\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\\r\\nelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles\\r\\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\\r\\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\\r\\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\\r\\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\\r\\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\\r\\nwould have been a grievance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\\r\\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\\r\\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\\r\\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\\r\\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\\r\\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\\r\\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\\r\\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\\r\\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\\r\\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\\r\\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\\r\\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\\r\\nincome go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman\\r\\nwhom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will\\r\\nand contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,\\r\\nwas interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's\\r\\nmerits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with\\r\\nblessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours\\r\\nand friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and\\r\\ncheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a\\r\\nrecommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was\\r\\na great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,\\r\\nfull of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an\\r\\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\r\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\\r\\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous\\r\\npay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,\\r\\nhonest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of\\r\\naccomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might\\r\\nbe sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little\\r\\neducation, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's\\r\\nschool was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was\\r\\nreckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,\\r\\ngave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great\\r\\ndeal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own\\r\\nhands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\r\\nafter her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who\\r\\nhad worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the\\r\\noccasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat\\r\\nparlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose\\r\\na few sixpences by his fireside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\\r\\ncollect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though,\\r\\nas far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of\\r\\nMrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and\\r\\nvery much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the\\r\\nquiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so\\r\\nspent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\\r\\npresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\\r\\nrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\\r\\nwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\\r\\nvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of\\r\\nher beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\\r\\nlonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\\r\\nher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody\\r\\nhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\\r\\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\\r\\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\\r\\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\\r\\nladies who had been at school there with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\r\\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\\r\\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great\\r\\nsweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased\\r\\nwith her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\\r\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\r\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\r\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\r\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed\\r\\nby the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\\r\\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\\r\\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\\r\\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury\\r\\nand its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were\\r\\nunworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very\\r\\ngood sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the\\r\\nname of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large\\r\\nfarm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very\\r\\ncreditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\\r\\nthem--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\\r\\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\r\\nto be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve her; she\\r\\nwould detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good\\r\\nsociety; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an\\r\\ninteresting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her\\r\\nown situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\\r\\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\\r\\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\\r\\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\\r\\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the\\r\\nfire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse\\r\\nof a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every\\r\\nthing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted\\r\\nwith its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and\\r\\nhelp and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an\\r\\nurgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil\\r\\nscruples of their guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.\\r\\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\\r\\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\\r\\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would\\r\\nhave welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health\\r\\nmade him grieve that they would eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,\\r\\nwith thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain\\r\\nhimself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to\\r\\nsay:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\\r\\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\\r\\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\\r\\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of\\r\\nour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\\r\\n_little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\\r\\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\\r\\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\\r\\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could\\r\\ndisagree with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much\\r\\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\\r\\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\\r\\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\\r\\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\\r\\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\\r\\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands\\r\\nwith her at last!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\\r\\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and\\r\\ntelling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so\\r\\ndid their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had\\r\\nvery early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect\\r\\nMrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the\\r\\nshrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long\\r\\nwalk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage\\r\\nher exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to\\r\\nRandalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,\\r\\none whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable\\r\\naddition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of\\r\\nher, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\\r\\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\\r\\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself\\r\\nwas very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\\r\\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no\\r\\nwant of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\\r\\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\\r\\nyoung friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.\\r\\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\\r\\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\\r\\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the\\r\\nobject of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet\\r\\nwould be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there\\r\\nwas nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\r\\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\\r\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\\r\\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in\\r\\nthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\\r\\nhad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what\\r\\nMrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of\\r\\nthe school in general, formed naturally a great part of the\\r\\nconversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\\r\\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\\r\\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\\r\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\r\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\\r\\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\\r\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\r\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin's having \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_two_ parlours, two very good\\r\\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's\\r\\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\\r\\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\\r\\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\\r\\ncow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,\\r\\nit should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\\r\\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\\r\\ndrink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\\r\\npeople.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\\r\\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\\r\\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\\r\\ndaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it\\r\\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\\r\\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\\r\\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\\r\\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\r\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not\\r\\ntaken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\\r\\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\r\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\\r\\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening\\r\\ngames; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and\\r\\nobliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her\\r\\nsome walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in\\r\\nevery thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into\\r\\nthe parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond\\r\\nof singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very\\r\\nclever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while\\r\\nshe was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in\\r\\nthe country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and\\r\\nsisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and\\r\\nthere was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\\r\\nto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he\\r\\nwould make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was\\r\\nin no hurry at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell done, Mrs. Martin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know what you are about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\r\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\\r\\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\\r\\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\\r\\nhis own business? He does not read?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a\\r\\ngood deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\\r\\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window\\r\\nseats--but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,\\r\\nbefore we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the\\r\\nElegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of\\r\\nWakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of\\r\\nthe Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but\\r\\nhe is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next question was--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\\r\\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\\r\\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and\\r\\nthen, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.\\r\\nHe has passed you very often.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\\r\\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\\r\\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\\r\\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.\\r\\nA degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;\\r\\nI might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But\\r\\na farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as\\r\\nmuch above my notice as in every other he is below it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;\\r\\nbut he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\\r\\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\\r\\nhis age to be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\\r\\n23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\\r\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they\\r\\nare, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably\\r\\nrepent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young\\r\\nwoman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very\\r\\ndesirable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSix years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not\\r\\nborn to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely\\r\\nto make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he\\r\\nmight come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family\\r\\nproperty, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and\\r\\nso forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in\\r\\ntime, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing\\r\\nyet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\\r\\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\\r\\nof taking a boy another year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\r\\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his\\r\\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\\r\\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\\r\\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\\r\\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\\r\\ngentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by\\r\\nevery thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who\\r\\nwould take pleasure in degrading you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\\r\\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\\r\\nbody can do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would\\r\\nhave you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent\\r\\neven of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently\\r\\nwell connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd\\r\\nacquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still\\r\\nbe in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn\\r\\nin by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,\\r\\nwho will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\r\\nbut what had had some education--and been very well brought up. However,\\r\\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall\\r\\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\\r\\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\\r\\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\\r\\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\\r\\nvisit her, if I can help it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\\r\\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but\\r\\nshe trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious\\r\\ndifficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her\\r\\nown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\r\\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\\r\\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\\r\\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\\r\\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\\r\\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\\r\\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\\r\\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen,\\r\\nshe thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's\\r\\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\\r\\nnoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\\r\\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\\r\\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\\r\\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\\r\\ncompose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was quite\\r\\na chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\\r\\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\\r\\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\\r\\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it,\\r\\nbut he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him?\\r\\nDo you think him so very plain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing\\r\\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\\r\\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\\r\\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\\r\\ndegree or two nearer gentility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che is not so genteel\\r\\nas real gentlemen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\r\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\\r\\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,\\r\\nyou have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I\\r\\nshould be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company\\r\\nwith Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior\\r\\ncreature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him\\r\\nat all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not\\r\\nyou struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and\\r\\nabrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly\\r\\nunmodulated as I stood here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and\\r\\nway of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But\\r\\nMr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\\r\\ncompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\\r\\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\\r\\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\\r\\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\\r\\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.\\r\\nYou must see the difference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\\r\\nman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\\r\\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\\r\\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\\r\\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\\r\\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\\r\\nWeston's time of life?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no saying, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Harriet rather solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\\r\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\\r\\nnothing but profit and loss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill he, indeed? That will be very bad.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\r\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\r\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\r\\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\\r\\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\\r\\nrich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\\r\\n_us_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder he did not remember the book\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--was all Harriet's answer, and\\r\\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\\r\\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\\r\\nnext beginning was,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be\\r\\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\\r\\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\\r\\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to\\r\\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding\\r\\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\\r\\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set\\r\\nabout copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think\\r\\na young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a\\r\\nmodel. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\\r\\nHe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\\r\\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\\r\\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\\r\\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please\\r\\nyou. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.\\r\\nElton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and\\r\\nsaid she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\\r\\nfarmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent\\r\\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\\r\\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\\r\\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\\r\\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\\r\\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to\\r\\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense\\r\\nof its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the\\r\\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\\r\\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\\r\\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\\r\\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\r\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\\r\\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\\r\\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\r\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\\r\\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little\\r\\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\\r\\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\\r\\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very\\r\\nhandsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\\r\\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\\r\\nwith:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding\\r\\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by\\r\\nMr. Elton's admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I\\r\\nthink it a bad thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think they will neither of them do the other any good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a\\r\\nnew object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been\\r\\nseeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently\\r\\nwe feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This will\\r\\ncertainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\\r\\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks\\r\\nexactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,\\r\\nand agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a\\r\\ngirl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not\\r\\nallow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live\\r\\nalone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no\\r\\nman can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of\\r\\none of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine\\r\\nyour objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman\\r\\nwhich Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants\\r\\nto see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more\\r\\nherself. They will read together. She means it, I know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.\\r\\nI have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of\\r\\nbooks that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\\r\\nthey were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\\r\\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew\\r\\nup when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\\r\\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\\r\\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\\r\\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing\\r\\nrequiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\\r\\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\\r\\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her\\r\\nto read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I thought so\\r\\n_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting\\r\\nto do any thing I wished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--said\\r\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he soon added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\\r\\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\\r\\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to\\r\\nanswer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always\\r\\nquick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she\\r\\nwas twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her\\r\\nmother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her\\r\\nmother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\\r\\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another\\r\\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\\r\\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are better placed _here_; very fit for a\\r\\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to\\r\\nbe an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\\r\\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\\r\\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on the\\r\\nvery material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing\\r\\nas you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I\\r\\nshould certainly have named Miss Taylor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\\r\\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that\\r\\nwith every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We\\r\\nwill not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of\\r\\ncomfort, or his son may plague him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\\r\\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's\\r\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\\r\\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\\r\\nHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\\r\\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\\r\\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\\r\\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\\r\\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\\r\\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\\r\\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_ cannot\\r\\ngain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit\\r\\nwith all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined\\r\\nenough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances\\r\\nhave placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any\\r\\nstrength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally\\r\\nto the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little\\r\\npolish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\\r\\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\\r\\nHow well she looked last night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\\r\\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\\r\\nbeauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\\r\\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\\r\\nold friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\\r\\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\\r\\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\\r\\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\\r\\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'\\r\\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\\r\\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not a fault to find with her person,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think her\\r\\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\\r\\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\\r\\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\\r\\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\\r\\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\\r\\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an\\r\\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\\r\\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\\r\\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\\r\\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\\r\\ntimes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\\r\\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.\\r\\nJohn loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection,\\r\\nand Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite\\r\\nfrightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions\\r\\nwith me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\\r\\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\\r\\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's\\r\\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\\r\\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a\\r\\nmatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\\r\\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\\r\\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\\r\\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\\r\\nsource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\\r\\ngive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little\\r\\nremains of office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am much obliged to you for it. It is very\\r\\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\\r\\nfound; for it shall be attended to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\\r\\nher sister.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe satisfied,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\\r\\nill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\\r\\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\\r\\nperhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\\r\\nfeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo do I,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston gently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\\r\\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\\r\\ncared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\\r\\nwith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\\r\\ndoubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\\r\\nto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution\\r\\nat present,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas can well be; and while she is so\\r\\nhappy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which\\r\\nwould be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I\\r\\ndo not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight\\r\\nto the state, I assure you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\\r\\nand Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\\r\\nat Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to\\r\\nhave them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\\r\\nafterwards made to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does Weston think of the weather; shall we have\\r\\nrain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about\\r\\nHartfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper\\r\\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\\r\\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\\r\\nElton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\\r\\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\\r\\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating\\r\\nas much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for.\\r\\nShe was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of\\r\\nfalling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard\\r\\nto him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\\r\\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His\\r\\nperception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her\\r\\nintroduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of\\r\\nhis growing attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have given Miss Smith all that she required,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou have\\r\\nmade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she\\r\\ncame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\\r\\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\\r\\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\\r\\nnatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\\r\\ndone very little.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it were admissible to contradict a lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the gallant Mr.\\r\\nElton--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\\r\\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\\r\\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\\r\\nmore truly amiable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\\r\\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\\r\\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\\r\\nto have Harriet's picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid you\\r\\never sit for your picture?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\\r\\nwith a very interesting naivete,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! dear, no, never.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\\r\\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\\r\\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\\r\\npassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\\r\\nwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\\r\\nanother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\\r\\nif Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\\r\\npicture!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me entreat you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Elton; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit would indeed be a delight!\\r\\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent\\r\\nin favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could\\r\\nyou suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\\r\\nlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\\r\\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\\r\\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in raptures\\r\\nabout mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if you give me\\r\\nsuch kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.\\r\\nHarriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;\\r\\nand yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines\\r\\nabout the mouth which one ought to catch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have\\r\\nnot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\\r\\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\\r\\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering\\r\\nme? How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\\r\\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\r\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\\r\\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly,\\r\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at\\r\\nportraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might\\r\\ndecide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were\\r\\ndisplayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and\\r\\nwater-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do\\r\\nevery thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than\\r\\nmany might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.\\r\\nShe played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness\\r\\nhad always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of\\r\\nexcellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to\\r\\nhave failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either\\r\\nas an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others\\r\\ndeceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often\\r\\nhigher than it deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\\r\\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\\r\\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\\r\\nwould have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness\\r\\npleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo great variety of faces for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had only my own\\r\\nfamily to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but the\\r\\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\\r\\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\\r\\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\\r\\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\\r\\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and\\r\\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\\r\\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw\\r\\nher four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\\r\\nattempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and\\r\\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\\r\\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\\r\\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\\r\\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\\r\\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\\r\\ncoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my\\r\\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\\r\\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\\r\\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very\\r\\nlike. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very\\r\\ngood. Then here is my last,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\r\\nin small size, whole-length--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy last and my best--my brother, Mr. John\\r\\nKnightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away\\r\\nin a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not\\r\\nhelp being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made\\r\\na very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in\\r\\nthinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too flattering--but\\r\\nthat was a fault on the right side\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--after all this, came poor dear\\r\\nIsabella's cold approbation of--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it was a little like--but to be\\r\\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble\\r\\nin persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\\r\\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\\r\\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\\r\\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then\\r\\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather\\r\\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\\r\\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was\\r\\nrepeating, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\\r\\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with so interesting a\\r\\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\\r\\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\\r\\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be\\r\\na whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was\\r\\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station\\r\\nover the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\\r\\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\\r\\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\\r\\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\\r\\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\\r\\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\\r\\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\\r\\nto employ him in reading.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\r\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the\\r\\nirksomeness of Miss Smith's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\\r\\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less\\r\\nwould certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the\\r\\nsmallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,\\r\\nand be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,\\r\\nfor his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it\\r\\nwas possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his\\r\\ncomplaisance were unexceptionable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\\r\\npleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\\r\\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\\r\\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\\r\\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of\\r\\nits being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling\\r\\nits destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the\\r\\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;\\r\\nwith as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising\\r\\nattachment was likely to add.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\\r\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\\r\\nparty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\\r\\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\\r\\npicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\\r\\nbut Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\\r\\ncriticism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\r\\nwanted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting that\\r\\nshe was addressing a lover.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe expression of the eye is most correct,\\r\\nbut Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\\r\\nher face that she has them not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot agree with you. It appears\\r\\nto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\\r\\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have made her too tall, Emma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\\r\\nadded,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she\\r\\nis sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short\\r\\ngives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\\r\\nProportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\\r\\nsuch a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very pretty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo prettily done! Just as your\\r\\ndrawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well\\r\\nas you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems\\r\\nto be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\\r\\nshoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\\r\\nLook at the tree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, sir, may say any thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Elton, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I must confess that\\r\\nI regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of\\r\\ndoors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other\\r\\nsituation would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss\\r\\nSmith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep\\r\\nmy eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few\\r\\ndifficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the\\r\\norder must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\\r\\ncould be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\\r\\nmust not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\\r\\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of\\r\\nDecember. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it\\r\\nwas removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight he be trusted\\r\\nwith the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing\\r\\nit! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how\\r\\nmuch he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give\\r\\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--brought on the desired\\r\\nrepetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled\\r\\nthe business.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\\r\\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\\r\\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\\r\\nnot being incommoded enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a precious deposit!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he with a tender sigh, as he received\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis man is almost too gallant to be in love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should\\r\\nsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\\r\\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\\r\\nexactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does\\r\\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\\r\\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\\r\\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet's account.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion\\r\\nfor Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\\r\\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\\r\\nreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\\r\\ntalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\\r\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\\r\\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\\r\\nMrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\\r\\nfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\\r\\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\\r\\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which\\r\\nshe had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was\\r\\nfrom him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what\\r\\nto do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,\\r\\nat least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very\\r\\nmuch--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could to\\r\\nask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emma was half-ashamed of her\\r\\nfriend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe young man is determined not to lose any\\r\\nthing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you read the letter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray do. I'd rather you\\r\\nwould.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style\\r\\nof the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no\\r\\ngrammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a\\r\\ngentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and\\r\\nthe sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was\\r\\nshort, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,\\r\\neven delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood\\r\\nanxiously watching for her opinion, with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and was at last\\r\\nforced to add, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it a good letter? or is it too short?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, a very good letter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma rather slowly--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cso\\r\\ngood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\\r\\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom\\r\\nI saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\\r\\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\\r\\nno, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\\r\\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\\r\\ntalent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\\r\\nhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.\\r\\nYes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments\\r\\nto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet\\r\\n(returning it,) than I had expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the still waiting Harriet;--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell--and--and what shall I\\r\\ndo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\\r\\nletter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and\\r\\nspeedily.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express\\r\\nyourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not\\r\\nbeing intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\\r\\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\\r\\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\\r\\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\\r\\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\\r\\ndisappointment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou think I ought to refuse him then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet, looking down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOught to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\\r\\ndoubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\\r\\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel\\r\\nin doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were\\r\\nconsulting me only as to the wording of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you\\r\\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\\r\\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had no notion that he liked me so very much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet,\\r\\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\\r\\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\\r\\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\\r\\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse\\r\\nhim. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No' directly.\\r\\nIt is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with\\r\\nhalf a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,\\r\\nto say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would\\r\\njust advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As\\r\\nyou say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\\r\\nhesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,'\\r\\nperhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot for the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, smiling graciously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould I advise you\\r\\neither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\\r\\nprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\\r\\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\\r\\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at\\r\\nthis moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\\r\\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\\r\\nmoment whom are you thinking of?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\\r\\nconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\\r\\nstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.\\r\\nEmma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At\\r\\nlast, with some hesitation, Harriet said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well\\r\\nas I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost\\r\\nmade up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\\r\\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\\r\\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\\r\\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would\\r\\nhave grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\\r\\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\\r\\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;\\r\\nbut it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have\\r\\nvisited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you\\r\\nfor ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\\r\\nforcibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could not have visited me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, looking aghast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, to be\\r\\nsure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\\r\\nbeen too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\\r\\ngive up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing\\r\\nin the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\\r\\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\\r\\nI must have given you up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\\r\\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\\r\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\\r\\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\\r\\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think he is conceited either, in general,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet, her\\r\\nconscience opposing such censure; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat least, he is very good natured,\\r\\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\\r\\nfor--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though\\r\\nhe may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must\\r\\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes\\r\\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\\r\\n_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\\r\\nMartin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\\r\\nhis being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as\\r\\nto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\\r\\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\\r\\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery\\r\\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\\r\\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\\r\\nher husband could write a good letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\\r\\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But\\r\\nhow shall I do? What shall I say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised\\r\\nits being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her\\r\\nassistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance\\r\\nbeing wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.\\r\\nThe looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a\\r\\nsoftening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up\\r\\nwith a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at\\r\\nthe idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother\\r\\nand sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not\\r\\nfancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in\\r\\nher way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\\r\\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\\r\\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by\\r\\nspeaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of\\r\\nMr. Elton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was said in rather a\\r\\nsorrowful tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\\r\\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but\\r\\nat Hartfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time afterwards it was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\\r\\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would--for\\r\\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\\r\\nlinen-draper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\\r\\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\\r\\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\\r\\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\\r\\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\\r\\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I\\r\\nare the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\\r\\nthemselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\\r\\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\\r\\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\\r\\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow he has got my letter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she softly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder what they are all\\r\\ndoing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy\\r\\ntoo. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\\r\\nemployed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\\r\\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\\r\\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\\r\\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\\r\\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\\r\\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\\r\\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\\r\\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\\r\\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\\r\\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\\r\\ntheir imaginations all are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\\r\\nspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have\\r\\na bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\\r\\nrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\\r\\njust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\\r\\ntwo to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should\\r\\nreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\\r\\nmind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was\\r\\ninduced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his\\r\\nown civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nwho had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short,\\r\\ndecided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and\\r\\ncivil hesitations of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\\r\\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and\\r\\ngo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\\r\\nbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\\r\\nMr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\\r\\nentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\\r\\nthree turns--my winter walk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot do better, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a\\r\\nvery slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you\\r\\nhave another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\\r\\nthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the\\r\\ngarden door for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\\r\\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\\r\\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\\r\\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot rate her beauty as you do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut she is a\\r\\npretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\\r\\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\\r\\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\\r\\nwanting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\\r\\nthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl's\\r\\ngiggle; she really does you credit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been\\r\\nof some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they\\r\\nmay. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlmost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\\r\\nintended.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHighbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\\r\\nnothing. He presently added, with a smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that\\r\\nI have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\\r\\nsomething to her advantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed! how so? of what sort?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very serious sort, I assure you;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d still smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her?\\r\\nWho makes you their confidant?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.\\r\\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr.\\r\\nElton looked up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have reason to think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Harriet Smith will soon have\\r\\nan offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert\\r\\nMartin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have\\r\\ndone his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is very obliging,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut is he sure that Harriet means to\\r\\nmarry him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\\r\\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\\r\\nI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\\r\\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether\\r\\nI thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether\\r\\nI thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\\r\\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\\r\\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\\r\\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\\r\\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\\r\\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\\r\\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\\r\\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and\\r\\nbrother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me\\r\\nthat he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\\r\\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\\r\\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\\r\\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\\r\\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\\r\\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\\r\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear\\r\\nto have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking\\r\\nhim at all a tiresome wretch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, Mr. Knightley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\r\\nthrough a great part of this speech, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow do you know that Mr. Martin\\r\\ndid not speak yesterday?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he, surprized, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not absolutely know it; but it\\r\\nmay be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will tell you something, in return for what\\r\\nyou have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\\r\\nrefused.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\\r\\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood\\r\\nup, in tall indignation, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\\r\\nfoolish girl about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! to be sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is always incomprehensible to a man\\r\\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\\r\\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\\r\\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\\r\\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\\r\\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\\r\\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\\r\\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized\\r\\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\\r\\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\\r\\ngot over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot Harriet's equal!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\\r\\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, he is\\r\\nnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\\r\\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\\r\\nHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\\r\\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\\r\\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\\r\\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder\\r\\nat a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any\\r\\ninformation. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and\\r\\ntoo simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have\\r\\nno experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have\\r\\nany that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and\\r\\nthat is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,\\r\\nas being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,\\r\\nas to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\\r\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I\\r\\ncould not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there\\r\\nbeing no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in\\r\\ngood hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.\\r\\nThe advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the\\r\\nsmallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out\\r\\nupon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.\\r\\nIt crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's\\r\\nleaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember\\r\\nsaying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will\\r\\nthink this a good match.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any\\r\\nsuch thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his\\r\\nmerit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!\\r\\nNot regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom\\r\\nI could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should\\r\\nthink it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are\\r\\nvery different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are\\r\\nnot just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently\\r\\nby others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,\\r\\nbut he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in\\r\\nwhich she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\\r\\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\\r\\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\\r\\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\\r\\nwhom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\\r\\nis a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is\\r\\nvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\\r\\ncomfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\\r\\nshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\\r\\ndeny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhoever might be her parents,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhoever may have\\r\\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\\r\\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After\\r\\nreceiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's\\r\\nhands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line,\\r\\nto have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought\\r\\nthis good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough. She desired nothing\\r\\nbetter herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had\\r\\nno distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as\\r\\nhappy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of\\r\\nsuperiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no\\r\\nfriend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded\\r\\nso far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to\\r\\nhim. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any\\r\\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is\\r\\nthe farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had\\r\\nencouragement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\r\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\\r\\nare unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so\\r\\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\\r\\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her\\r\\nunderstanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and\\r\\nsupposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured,\\r\\nlet me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not\\r\\ntrivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a\\r\\nbeautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an\\r\\nhundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the\\r\\nsubject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\\r\\nin love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with\\r\\nsuch loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought\\r\\nafter, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a\\r\\nclaim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,\\r\\ncomprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and\\r\\nmanner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to\\r\\nbe pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in\\r\\ngeneral would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims\\r\\na woman could possess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\\r\\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\\r\\nit as you do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried she playfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know _that_ is the feeling of\\r\\nyou all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every\\r\\nman delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\\r\\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\\r\\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\\r\\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\\r\\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray let\\r\\nher have time to look about her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley\\r\\npresently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive\\r\\nthat it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up\\r\\nwith such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,\\r\\nin a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.\\r\\nVanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing\\r\\nso easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss\\r\\nHarriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though\\r\\nshe is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to\\r\\nsay, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of\\r\\nconnecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent\\r\\nmen would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be\\r\\ninvolved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let\\r\\nher marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for\\r\\never; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her\\r\\nto be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large\\r\\nfortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest\\r\\nof her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry\\r\\nsomebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the\\r\\nold writing-master's son.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\\r\\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\\r\\nangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible;\\r\\nshe has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any\\r\\nsecond application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him,\\r\\nwhatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to\\r\\nsay that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there\\r\\nwas very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much\\r\\nagainst him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to\\r\\nfavour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen\\r\\nany body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her\\r\\nfriends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\\r\\nnobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not,\\r\\nwhile she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case\\r\\nis altered now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a\\r\\ngentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr.\\r\\nKnightley.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRobert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and\\r\\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than\\r\\nHarriet Smith could understand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\\r\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\\r\\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\\r\\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\\r\\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\\r\\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\\r\\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\\r\\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\\r\\non Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\\r\\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRobert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope it\\r\\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\\r\\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\\r\\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as\\r\\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\\r\\nwill be all labour in vain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDepend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\\r\\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\\r\\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\\r\\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\\r\\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.\\r\\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\\r\\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\\r\\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\\r\\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\\r\\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\\r\\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, laughing again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had\\r\\nset my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very\\r\\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\\r\\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\\r\\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood morning to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\\r\\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\\r\\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had\\r\\ngiven; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,\\r\\nwas provoking him exceedingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\r\\nindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always\\r\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\r\\nher opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\\r\\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\\r\\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\\r\\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying\\r\\naway so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the\\r\\nyoung man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with\\r\\nHarriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\\r\\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\\r\\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any\\r\\nsuch reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\\r\\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\\r\\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's\\r\\nfriendship and woman's feelings would not justify.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\r\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\\r\\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of\\r\\nMr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such\\r\\na question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she\\r\\nwas able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully\\r\\nto be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have\\r\\nheard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and\\r\\nMr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to\\r\\nmoney matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise\\r\\nto them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the\\r\\ninfluence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr.\\r\\nKnightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its\\r\\neffects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming\\r\\nany hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and\\r\\nmore than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure\\r\\ndid not belong to Mr. Elton.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\\r\\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\\r\\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\\r\\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\\r\\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\\r\\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\\r\\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road\\r\\nto London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\\r\\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\\r\\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\\r\\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to\\r\\npersuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\\r\\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\\r\\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\\r\\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a\\r\\nvery enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\\r\\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure\\r\\nthere must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton\\r\\nonly looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\\r\\nMiss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about\\r\\nMr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat she did\\r\\nnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only\\r\\nknew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the\\r\\nluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his\\r\\nequal for beauty or agreeableness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\\r\\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before\\r\\nhe came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks\\r\\nshewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent.\\r\\nOn the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified\\r\\nand endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\\r\\nElton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\r\\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\\r\\nof admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were\\r\\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as\\r\\nher youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied\\r\\nof Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a\\r\\ncontrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of\\r\\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\\r\\nfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\\r\\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\\r\\nrange and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\\r\\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\\r\\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\\r\\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\\r\\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\\r\\nquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\\r\\nciphers and trophies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\\r\\nnot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out\\r\\nat least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it\\r\\nfrom her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.\\r\\nEmma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote\\r\\na very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first\\r\\norder, in form as well as quantity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\\r\\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\\r\\nin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\\r\\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n And it always ended in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\\r\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he\\r\\nhad desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\\r\\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury\\r\\nin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\\r\\nwhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good\\r\\nenigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had\\r\\nthe pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections;\\r\\nand at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that\\r\\nnothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the\\r\\nsex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest\\r\\npuzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and\\r\\nrather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,\\r\\n\\r\\n    My first doth affliction denote,\\r\\n      Which my second is destin'd to feel\\r\\n    And my whole is the best antidote\\r\\n      That affliction to soften and heal.--\\r\\n\\r\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\\r\\npages ago already.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nis the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\\r\\nlife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--he\\r\\nstopt a moment--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cor Miss Smith could inspire him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He\\r\\ncalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\\r\\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\\r\\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\\r\\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing my\\r\\nfriend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\\r\\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\\r\\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found\\r\\nit easier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the next\\r\\nmoment:--after another moment's pause,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\\r\\nHarriet--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is for you. Take your own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\\r\\nloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n        To Miss--\\r\\n\\r\\n          CHARADE.\\r\\n\\r\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\r\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\r\\n    Another view of man, my second brings,\\r\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\r\\n\\r\\n    But ah! united, what reverse we have!\\r\\n      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\\r\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\r\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\\r\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\\r\\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\\r\\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while\\r\\nHarriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and\\r\\ndulness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\\r\\ncharades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\\r\\nis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--'Pray, Miss Smith,\\r\\ngive me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\\r\\nintentions in the same glance.'\\r\\n\\r\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the\\r\\njustest that could be given.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\\r\\nlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\\r\\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\\r\\nyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\\r\\nindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\\r\\nnow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\\r\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\\r\\neagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I\\r\\ncannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\\r\\nit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it\\r\\nkingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.\\r\\nDo you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\\r\\n\\r\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan it be Neptune?\\r\\n\\r\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\r\\n\\r\\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\\r\\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\\r\\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend\\r\\nupon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Miss ------, read Miss Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\r\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is _court_.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Another view of man, my second brings;\\r\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.\\r\\n\\r\\n    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\\r\\n      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\\r\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\r\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which\\r\\nI think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\\r\\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\\r\\nits being written for you and to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read\\r\\nthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\\r\\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\\r\\nEmma spoke for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You\\r\\nare his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\\r\\nthought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it\\r\\nis clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on\\r\\nthe subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long\\r\\nhave I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.\\r\\nI could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were\\r\\nmost desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have\\r\\nreally so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my\\r\\ndear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may\\r\\nwell feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing\\r\\nbut good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration,\\r\\nindependence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your\\r\\nreal friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy\\r\\nfor ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in\\r\\neither of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Miss Woodhouse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was all that Harriet,\\r\\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\\r\\narrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to\\r\\nher friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she\\r\\nought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever you say is always right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand therefore I\\r\\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\\r\\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\\r\\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\\r\\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--'To Miss ------.'\\r\\nDear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\\r\\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to\\r\\nthe play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\\r\\nmatter-of-fact prose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,\\r\\na month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take\\r\\nplace!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\\r\\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\\r\\nevidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of\\r\\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\\r\\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\\r\\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\\r\\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\\r\\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\\r\\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The course of true love never did run smooth--\\r\\n\\r\\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\\r\\npassage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,\\r\\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\\r\\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\\r\\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\\r\\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\\r\\nthat he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\\r\\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\\r\\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\\r\\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and\\r\\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\\r\\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\\r\\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me\\r\\nlook too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\\r\\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must\\r\\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\\r\\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\\r\\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\\r\\nevery assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same\\r\\ncountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\\r\\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\\r\\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\\r\\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\\r\\nthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand\\r\\nevery thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This\\r\\ncharade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any\\r\\nthing like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\\r\\nyesterday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is as long again as almost all we have had before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things\\r\\nin general cannot be too short.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\\r\\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is one thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cto have\\r\\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\\r\\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\\r\\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\\r\\nthis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's\\r\\nprose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch sweet lines!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Harriet--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese two last!--But how shall I\\r\\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?--Oh! Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\\r\\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\\r\\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall\\r\\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\\r\\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not\\r\\nwrite it into your book.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! but those two lines are\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\\r\\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\\r\\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\\r\\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\\r\\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon\\r\\nit, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his\\r\\npassion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or\\r\\nneither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be\\r\\nno possible reflection on you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\\r\\nso as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\\r\\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\\r\\nof publicity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca most natural feeling; and the longer it\\r\\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\\r\\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\\r\\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\\r\\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\\r\\ngallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet looked grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You\\r\\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\\r\\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\\r\\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\\r\\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\\r\\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\\r\\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\\r\\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\\r\\nthis charade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\\r\\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dears, how does\\r\\nyour book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\\r\\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,\\r\\nby a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\\r\\nit in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\\r\\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\\r\\npart as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\\r\\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.\\r\\n'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I\\r\\ncan easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so\\r\\nprettily, but you, Emma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very\\r\\ntender sigh, he added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\r\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\\r\\nremember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have\\r\\nheard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\\r\\nseveral.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\\r\\n      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\\r\\n    The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,\\r\\n    Though of his near approach afraid,\\r\\n      So fatal to my suit before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all\\r\\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\\r\\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\\r\\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\\r\\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her--and what\\r\\nroom there will be for the children?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\r\\nhas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you\\r\\nknow. Why should there be any change?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\\r\\nsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's\\r\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken\\r\\naway from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see\\r\\nMiss Taylor here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe will not be surprized, papa, at least.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\\r\\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\\r\\nhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she\\r\\nis coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of\\r\\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\\r\\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\\r\\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken\\r\\nout for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this\\r\\nChristmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him, than\\r\\nwith us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\\r\\nanywhere but at Hartfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his\\r\\nbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musing\\r\\na little while, and then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\\r\\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\\r\\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I\\r\\ndo not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\\r\\nhusband.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\\r\\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\\r\\nby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately\\r\\nled to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother\\r\\nand sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children.\\r\\nWe are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she\\r\\nwill think the handsomest, Henry or John?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\\r\\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHenry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\\r\\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\\r\\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\\r\\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\\r\\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\\r\\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\\r\\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\\r\\nof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\\r\\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\\r\\nthem very often.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe appears rough to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause you are so very gentle\\r\\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\\r\\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if\\r\\nthey misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\\r\\naffectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\\r\\nfather. The children are all fond of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\\r\\nvery frightful way!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\\r\\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\\r\\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I cannot understand it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\\r\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\\r\\nin preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this\\r\\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\\r\\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\\r\\nhis the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;\\r\\nand she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\\r\\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made\\r\\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\\r\\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\\r\\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\\r\\ndining with him--had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\\r\\nconditionally to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\\r\\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged--she\\r\\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\\r\\npaper from the table, she returned it--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank\\r\\nyou for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured\\r\\nto write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it\\r\\namiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight\\r\\nlines.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather\\r\\ndoubtingly--rather confused; said something about \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--glanced at\\r\\nEmma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took\\r\\nit up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an\\r\\nawkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\\r\\nmust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's\\r\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no hesitation in saying,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\\r\\na good deal while he spoke; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no hesitation in saying--at least\\r\\nif my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that,\\r\\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at the\\r\\nbook again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the\\r\\nproudest moment of his life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\\r\\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was\\r\\na sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\\r\\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\\r\\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\\r\\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\\r\\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\\r\\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\r\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of\\r\\nthe place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr.\\r\\nElton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about\\r\\na quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not\\r\\nvery good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\\r\\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\\r\\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\\r\\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\\r\\neyes.--Emma's remark was--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\\r\\ndays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Harriet's was--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow\\r\\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not often walk this way _now_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, as they proceeded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\n_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately\\r\\nacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part\\r\\nof Highbury.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage,\\r\\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors\\r\\nand probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with\\r\\nMr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish we could contrive it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I cannot think of any\\r\\ntolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire\\r\\nabout of his housekeeper--no message from my father.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some\\r\\nminutes, Harriet thus began again--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\\r\\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma laughed, and replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\\r\\nI must find other people charming--one other person at least. And I\\r\\nam not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\\r\\nintention of ever marrying at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\\r\\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\\r\\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather not\\r\\nbe tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I\\r\\nmust expect to repent it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\\r\\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in\\r\\nlove; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.\\r\\nAnd, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\\r\\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\\r\\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\\r\\nmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never\\r\\ncould I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and\\r\\nalways right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if\\r\\nI thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--so\\r\\nsmiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt\\r\\nto tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\\r\\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\\r\\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\\r\\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\\r\\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old\\r\\nmaid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good\\r\\nfortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant\\r\\nas any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the\\r\\ncandour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very\\r\\nnarrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\\r\\nThose who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and\\r\\ngenerally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This\\r\\ndoes not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and\\r\\ntoo silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste\\r\\nof every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not\\r\\ncontracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the\\r\\nworld, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody\\r\\nis afraid of her: that is a great charm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\\r\\ngrow old?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\\r\\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\\r\\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's\\r\\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\\r\\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\\r\\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\\r\\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\\r\\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\\r\\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\\r\\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough\\r\\nof them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that\\r\\ndeclining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every\\r\\nfear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it\\r\\nsuits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My\\r\\nnephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\\r\\na hundred times--but are you acquainted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\\r\\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\\r\\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\\r\\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\\r\\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from\\r\\nher is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round\\r\\nand round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a\\r\\nstomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of\\r\\nnothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires\\r\\nme to death.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\\r\\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\\r\\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\\r\\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\\r\\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\\r\\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\\r\\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\\r\\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\\r\\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\\r\\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\\r\\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\\r\\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\\r\\nevery thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\\r\\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\\r\\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor creatures! one can think of nothing\\r\\nelse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\\r\\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\\r\\ninto the lane again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think it will,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stopping to look once\\r\\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\\r\\ngreater within.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! dear, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\\r\\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\\r\\ntime only to say farther,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\\r\\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\\r\\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\\r\\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can\\r\\nfor them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet could just answer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! dear, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before the gentleman joined\\r\\nthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\\r\\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\\r\\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about\\r\\nwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\\r\\naccompany them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Emma;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cto meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\\r\\nof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\\r\\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\r\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\\r\\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\\r\\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of\\r\\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\\r\\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\\r\\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\\r\\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\\r\\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\\r\\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\\r\\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort\\r\\nof farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the\\r\\ncottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch\\r\\nbroth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to\\r\\nand question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have\\r\\nbeen the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;\\r\\nand by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without\\r\\nany obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\\r\\ninvoluntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;\\r\\nand she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in\\r\\na conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\\r\\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\\r\\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back\\r\\na little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\r\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only\\r\\ngiving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his\\r\\nfriend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,\\r\\nthe north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the\\r\\ndessert.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis would soon have led to something better, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her\\r\\nconsoling reflection; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany thing interests between those who love; and\\r\\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\\r\\ncould but have kept longer away!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\r\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\\r\\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and\\r\\nfall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,\\r\\nand dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to\\r\\nentreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to\\r\\nrights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPart of my lace is gone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I do not know how I am to\\r\\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\\r\\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop\\r\\nat your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,\\r\\nor any thing just to keep my boot on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\\r\\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and\\r\\nendeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were\\r\\ntaken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind\\r\\nit was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between\\r\\nthem was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive\\r\\nher assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave\\r\\nthe door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton\\r\\nshould close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but\\r\\nby engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make\\r\\nit practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining\\r\\nroom. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be\\r\\nprotracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her\\r\\nappearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\\r\\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having\\r\\nschemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.\\r\\nHe had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that\\r\\nhe had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little\\r\\ngallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCautious, very cautious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9che advances inch by inch, and\\r\\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\\r\\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\\r\\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them\\r\\nforward to the great event.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power\\r\\nto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\\r\\nsister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\\r\\nand then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\\r\\nand during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\\r\\nexpected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,\\r\\nfortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might\\r\\nadvance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or\\r\\nother whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure\\r\\nfor them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they\\r\\nwill do for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\\r\\nfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.\\r\\nTill this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been\\r\\ndivided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of\\r\\nthis autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was\\r\\ntherefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their\\r\\nSurry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be\\r\\ninduced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and\\r\\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\\r\\nforestalling this too short visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\\r\\nof the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\\r\\nof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\\r\\nthe sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\\r\\nKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,\\r\\nall reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,\\r\\nthe many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed\\r\\nand disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could\\r\\nnot have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even\\r\\nfor this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father\\r\\nwere so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\\r\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their\\r\\nhaving instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and\\r\\ndrinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,\\r\\nwithout the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long\\r\\na disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance\\r\\non them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet\\r\\nmanners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt\\r\\nup in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly\\r\\nattached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a\\r\\nwarmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault\\r\\nin any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any\\r\\nquickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also\\r\\nmuch of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful\\r\\nof that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond\\r\\nof her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.\\r\\nThey were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong\\r\\nhabit of regard for every old acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\r\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\\r\\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally\\r\\npleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an\\r\\nill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a\\r\\nreproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with\\r\\nsuch a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects\\r\\nin it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper\\r\\nmust hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she\\r\\nwanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\\r\\nin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\\r\\nIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\\r\\npassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,\\r\\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\\r\\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\\r\\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of\\r\\nall in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\\r\\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\\r\\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and\\r\\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\\r\\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John\\r\\nKnightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally\\r\\na strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's\\r\\ncharity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently\\r\\nto be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of\\r\\nevery visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of\\r\\nnecessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\\r\\nThey had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a\\r\\nmelancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention\\r\\nto the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried she with ready sympathy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow you must miss her!\\r\\nAnd dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so\\r\\ngrieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\\r\\nher.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the\\r\\nplace agrees with her tolerably.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts\\r\\nof the air of Randalls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\\r\\nlife--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery much to the honour of both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the handsome reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Isabella in the\\r\\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\\r\\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\\r\\nhave we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\\r\\neither at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\\r\\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\\r\\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,\\r\\nyou will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be\\r\\naware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be\\r\\nassured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by\\r\\nany means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact\\r\\ntruth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as it should be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. John Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand just as I hoped\\r\\nit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be\\r\\ndoubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I\\r\\nhave been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change\\r\\nbeing so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have\\r\\nEmma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, to be sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes, certainly--I cannot\\r\\ndeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\\r\\noften--but then--she is always obliged to go away again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite\\r\\nforget poor Mr. Weston.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Knightley pleasantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Mr. Weston has\\r\\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the\\r\\npoor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims\\r\\nof the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,\\r\\nshe has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all\\r\\nthe Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe, my love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\\r\\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\\r\\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss\\r\\nTaylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting\\r\\nMr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does\\r\\nnot deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever\\r\\nexisted. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal\\r\\nfor temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that\\r\\nvery windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last\\r\\nSeptember twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,\\r\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I\\r\\nhave been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better\\r\\nman in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is the young man?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Knightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas he been here on this\\r\\noccasion--or has he not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has not been here yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a strong\\r\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\\r\\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\\r\\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\\r\\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\\r\\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought\\r\\nit--and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,\\r\\ntime does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an\\r\\nexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal\\r\\nof pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\\r\\n28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it\\r\\nwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'--I remember that perfectly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow very pleasing and proper of him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\\r\\nKnightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\\r\\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\\r\\nsomething so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and\\r\\nnatural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with\\r\\nhim. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body\\r\\nwho proposed such a thing to any body else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Mr.\\r\\nJohn Knightley coolly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt\\r\\nwhat you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather\\r\\nan easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes\\r\\nthings as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,\\r\\ndepending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his\\r\\ncomforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing\\r\\nwhist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection,\\r\\nor any thing that home affords.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had\\r\\nhalf a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\\r\\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and\\r\\nvaluable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to\\r\\nhimself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on\\r\\nthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\\r\\nimportant.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\\r\\nIsabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it;\\r\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\\r\\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\\r\\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\\r\\ninvitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\\r\\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\\r\\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\\r\\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\\r\\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of\\r\\nfriendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children\\r\\nwith her--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who\\r\\nwas now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced\\r\\nabout in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave\\r\\nlooks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in\\r\\nthe usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the\\r\\nunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;\\r\\nand the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then\\r\\na little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the\\r\\nbaby,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\\r\\nAs to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with\\r\\nregard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,\\r\\nand as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with\\r\\nthem, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always\\r\\nthink alike.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\\r\\nwrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand reason good. I was sixteen years old when\\r\\nyou were born.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA material difference then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand no doubt you were much\\r\\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\\r\\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\\r\\nnearer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--a good deal _nearer_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\\r\\nthink differently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by\\r\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\\r\\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\\r\\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old\\r\\ngrievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery true. Little Emma, grow up a better\\r\\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\\r\\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\\r\\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects on\\r\\nmy side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that\\r\\nMr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man cannot be more so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his short, full answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley\\r\\nmade his appearance, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow d'ye do, George?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn, how are\\r\\nyou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that\\r\\nseemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led\\r\\neither of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\\r\\nentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\\r\\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\\r\\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\\r\\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in\\r\\none or the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\\r\\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\\r\\nand who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally\\r\\nsome point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious\\r\\nanecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at\\r\\nDonwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to\\r\\ngive all such local information as could not fail of being interesting\\r\\nto a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his\\r\\nlife, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change\\r\\nof a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for\\r\\nwheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality\\r\\nof interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his\\r\\nwilling brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries\\r\\neven approached a tone of eagerness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\\r\\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy poor dear Isabella,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, fondly taking her hand, and\\r\\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\\r\\nfive children--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\\r\\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\\r\\nmy dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and\\r\\nI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\\r\\nhave a little gruel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the\\r\\nMr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and\\r\\ntwo basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of\\r\\ngruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every\\r\\nbody, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\\r\\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should not\\r\\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\\r\\nthe weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\\r\\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\\r\\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\\r\\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must\\r\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--I\\r\\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\\r\\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and\\r\\nhe never forgets you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has\\r\\nnot time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to take\\r\\ncare of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all round\\r\\nthe country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But\\r\\nthen there is not so clever a man any where.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\\r\\nI have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\\r\\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\\r\\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\\r\\nyou had better let him look at little Bella's throat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\\r\\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\\r\\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\\r\\nWingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\\r\\nto her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\\r\\nspoken to--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention\\r\\nthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\\r\\nBates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--They\\r\\nare always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent Miss\\r\\nBates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\\r\\nbad cold about a month ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\r\\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\\r\\ngeneral or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\\r\\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\\r\\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\\r\\naltogether a sickly season.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\\r\\nexcept--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\\r\\na sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\\r\\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the\\r\\nair so bad!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\\r\\nvery superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\\r\\nin general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\\r\\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\\r\\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is\\r\\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:\\r\\nbut _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\\r\\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but\\r\\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\\r\\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think\\r\\nyou are any of you looking well at present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\\r\\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\\r\\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\\r\\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\\r\\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\\r\\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\\r\\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\\r\\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that\\r\\nyou do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning her eyes with\\r\\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiddling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\\r\\nvery far from looking well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. John\\r\\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\\r\\nwell--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\\r\\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you\\r\\nleft home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Isabella,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--exclaimed he hastily--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpray do not concern yourself\\r\\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\\r\\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabout your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff\\r\\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\\r\\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to\\r\\ngive her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\\r\\nworse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\\r\\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\\r\\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. John Knightley.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\r\\nis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\r\\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\\r\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\\r\\nregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at\\r\\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\\r\\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\\r\\ndelightful companion for Emma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\\r\\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\\r\\nbetter companion than Harriet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\\r\\nvery accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\\r\\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\\r\\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\\r\\na great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting\\r\\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty\\r\\nsevere Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\\r\\ntolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\\r\\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\\r\\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\\r\\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\\r\\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\\r\\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\\r\\ndangerous opening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\\r\\nwith tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\r\\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\\r\\ndoes not bear talking of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And for a little while she hoped he would not\\r\\ntalk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to\\r\\nthe relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,\\r\\nhowever, he began with,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\\r\\ninstead of coming here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a\\r\\ngreat deal of good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\\r\\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\\r\\nhear you had fixed upon South End.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\\r\\na mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never\\r\\nfound the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\\r\\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\\r\\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and\\r\\nhis own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry\\r\\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\\r\\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by\\r\\nwhat I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\\r\\nthe sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have\\r\\nconsulted Perry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\\r\\ngreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\r\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\\r\\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\\r\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into\\r\\na worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\\r\\nill-judged measure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he\\r\\nhad reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\r\\nbrother-in-law's breaking out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Perry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould do\\r\\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\\r\\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to\\r\\none part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\\r\\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his directions no more than\\r\\nhis drugs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\\r\\nsarcastic dryness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\\r\\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\\r\\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\\r\\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue, true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery\\r\\ntrue. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was telling\\r\\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\\r\\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\\r\\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\\r\\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\\r\\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\\r\\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\\r\\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\\r\\nyour opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\\r\\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\\r\\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing\\r\\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and\\r\\nthe immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\\r\\nother, prevented any renewal of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\\r\\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\\r\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what\\r\\nshe had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing\\r\\nto wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a\\r\\ndelightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\\r\\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\\r\\nthere was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\\r\\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was\\r\\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\\r\\nthe party.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\\r\\ncould, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually\\r\\nat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\\r\\nthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\\r\\nto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\\r\\nHarriet also.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\\r\\nonly persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as\\r\\nwell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being\\r\\nconsulted in every thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\\r\\nby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\\r\\na cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called\\r\\non her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to\\r\\nRandalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard\\r\\nwas full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet\\r\\nherself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her\\r\\nfrom this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss\\r\\nwithout many tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's\\r\\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.\\r\\nElton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last\\r\\ntolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most\\r\\ncomfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not\\r\\nadvanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr.\\r\\nElton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly\\r\\ntogether in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on the rumour\\r\\nof considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might\\r\\ncarry some report of her to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John\\r\\nKnightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest\\r\\nboys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country\\r\\nrun, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice\\r\\npudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\\r\\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's\\r\\ncomplaint;--\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\\r\\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\\r\\nalarmed her with them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\\r\\nhe exclaimed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\\r\\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\\r\\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\\r\\nWhy does not Perry see her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\\r\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and\\r\\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\\r\\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\\r\\nthan not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like\\r\\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\\r\\nshould really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from\\r\\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the\\r\\ncold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great\\r\\na disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,\\r\\nin your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a\\r\\nlittle hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\\r\\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\\r\\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\\r\\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\\r\\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\\r\\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,\\r\\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him\\r\\nimpartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with\\r\\nhis muttering acknowledgment of its being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery cold, certainly very\\r\\ncold,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,\\r\\nand secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour\\r\\nof the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do quite right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she;--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will make your apologies to Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Weston.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\\r\\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only\\r\\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\\r\\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\\r\\nhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\\r\\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\\r\\nhe next looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is most strange!--After I had got\\r\\nhim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\\r\\nbehind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\\r\\nespecially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining\\r\\nout--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\\r\\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any\\r\\nthing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\\r\\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love\\r\\nwith Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine\\r\\nout wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready\\r\\nwit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\r\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\\r\\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\\r\\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair\\r\\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\\r\\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and\\r\\nhe sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\\r\\napprobation much in his favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began\\r\\nwith--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\\r\\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\\r\\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please,\\r\\nevery feature works.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut where there is\\r\\na wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great\\r\\ndeal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will\\r\\nhave the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect\\r\\ngood-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che seems\\r\\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied with a smile of astonishment, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care you imagining me to\\r\\nbe Mr. Elton's object?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\r\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it\\r\\nis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\\r\\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\\r\\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and\\r\\nI are very good friends, and nothing more;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she walked on, amusing\\r\\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\\r\\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high\\r\\npretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well\\r\\npleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in\\r\\nwant of counsel. He said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\\r\\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking\\r\\nfrom it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest\\r\\ndaughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the\\r\\nweather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own\\r\\ngoing, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was\\r\\ncold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;\\r\\nand by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow\\r\\nwere finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so\\r\\novercharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world\\r\\nin a very short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\\r\\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\\r\\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\r\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\r\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\\r\\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\\r\\ndiscontent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust have a very good opinion of himself when he asks\\r\\npeople to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\\r\\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\\r\\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\\r\\nabsurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing\\r\\npeople to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying\\r\\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such\\r\\nan evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\\r\\nshould deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\\r\\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\\r\\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\\r\\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\\r\\nthat he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\\r\\nanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\r\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\r\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and\\r\\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\\r\\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\\r\\nat home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\\r\\ndoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true,\\r\\nmy love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which must have been usually administered by his travelling\\r\\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making\\r\\nany answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\\r\\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\\r\\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\r\\nher lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,\\r\\nspruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with\\r\\npleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and\\r\\ncheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she\\r\\nbegan to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from\\r\\nwhat had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had\\r\\nbeen, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch the same--not better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she presently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas not so\\r\\npleasant as I had hoped--'Not better' was _my_ answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\\r\\nsentiment as he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\\r\\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing\\r\\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\\r\\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--I\\r\\nhad flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I\\r\\nknew had been given her in the morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma smiled and answered--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy visit was of use to the nervous part of\\r\\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\\r\\nit is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\\r\\nprobably heard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\r\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\\r\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\\r\\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\\r\\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\r\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an excellent device,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe use of a sheepskin for\\r\\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\\r\\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\\r\\nrendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\\r\\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\\r\\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\\r\\ncold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!\\r\\nsnows a little I see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I think we shall have a good deal of\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChristmas weather,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Elton. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite seasonable; and\\r\\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\\r\\nyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly\\r\\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\\r\\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\\r\\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites\\r\\ntheir friends about them, and people think little of even the worst\\r\\nweather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing\\r\\ncould be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away\\r\\ntill that very day se'nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\\r\\nsaid only, coolly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\\r\\nastonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed\\r\\nquite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are sure of excellent fires,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand every thing in the\\r\\ngreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Weston\\r\\nindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\\r\\nhospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where\\r\\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\\r\\nMr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;\\r\\nand for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by\\r\\ntwo than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with\\r\\na soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\\r\\nthough Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of\\r\\nLondon, may not quite enter into our feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with\\r\\nany body.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\\r\\nbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will\\r\\nbe paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\\r\\nenjoyment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy first enjoyment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied John Knightley, as they passed through the\\r\\nsweep-gate, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\\r\\nwalked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his\\r\\njoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr.\\r\\nElton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\\r\\nplace.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\\r\\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\\r\\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\\r\\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\\r\\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\\r\\nunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\\r\\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\\r\\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\\r\\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication\\r\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life\\r\\ndepends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not\\r\\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the\\r\\nvery sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful\\r\\nto Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr.\\r\\nElton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that\\r\\nwas enjoyable to the utmost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through\\r\\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough\\r\\nto give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\\r\\nIsabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just\\r\\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\\r\\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost\\r\\nwholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and\\r\\nwelcome her dear Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry\\r\\nto find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.\\r\\nThe difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards\\r\\nHarriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\\r\\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\\r\\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\\r\\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\\r\\nsuggestion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\\r\\npossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\\r\\nHarriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Yet he would be so anxious\\r\\nfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\\r\\nand so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\\r\\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\\r\\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\\r\\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's,\\r\\nin the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively\\r\\ncivil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on\\r\\namongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's\\r\\nnonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough\\r\\nto know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she\\r\\nheard the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy son,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrank,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy son,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated several\\r\\ntimes over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected\\r\\nthat he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could\\r\\nquiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving\\r\\nquestion from her would have been awkward.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never\\r\\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.\\r\\nFrank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\\r\\nthought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that\\r\\nif she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\\r\\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\\r\\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be\\r\\na match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though\\r\\nnot meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\\r\\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\\r\\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention\\r\\nof finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and\\r\\na sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'\\r\\nimaginations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\\r\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\\r\\ncross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\\r\\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\\r\\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for\\r\\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\\r\\nat dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\\r\\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to\\r\\nher,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see\\r\\ntwo more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and\\r\\nthen I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me\\r\\ntelling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.\\r\\nI had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a\\r\\nfortnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\\r\\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party\\r\\nquite complete.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has been wanting to come to us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cever since\\r\\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\\r\\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\\r\\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\\r\\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\\r\\nJanuary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\\r\\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\\r\\nyourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\\r\\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\\r\\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this is\\r\\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other\\r\\nroom. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is, that a\\r\\nparty of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and\\r\\nthat Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not\\r\\nput off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family\\r\\nthat a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular\\r\\ndislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in\\r\\ntwo or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\\r\\nI have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing\\r\\nFrank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:\\r\\nbut your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table)\\r\\nhas so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at\\r\\nHartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been\\r\\nlong in the practice of doing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nEmma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\\r\\nwill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\\r\\nthe place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself\\r\\nto speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be very\\r\\nfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of\\r\\nany body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\\r\\nway--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\\r\\nto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\\r\\nthat he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say\\r\\nit to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\\r\\ngeneral; and the devil of a temper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\\r\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--yet\\r\\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\\r\\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\\r\\nsecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\\r\\nof: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\\r\\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\\r\\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Emma!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat is the certainty\\r\\nof caprice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\\r\\nbefore--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\\r\\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\\r\\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in\\r\\nshort, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\\r\\nthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\\r\\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Isabella:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest\\r\\ncompassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must\\r\\nbe dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but\\r\\nit must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any\\r\\nchildren! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\\r\\nheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\\r\\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\\r\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\\r\\nfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\\r\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\\r\\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\\r\\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after\\r\\ndinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\\r\\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\\r\\nwhom he was always comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\\r\\nsaying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\\r\\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\\r\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\\r\\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\\r\\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\\r\\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on\\r\\nthe Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They\\r\\nare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\\r\\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe ought to come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he could stay only a couple of days,\\r\\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having\\r\\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall into\\r\\nbad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants\\r\\nto be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under such\\r\\nrestraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he\\r\\nlikes it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\\r\\none decides upon what he can do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne ought to\\r\\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\\r\\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\\r\\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every\\r\\nthing gives way to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,\\r\\naccording to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that\\r\\nwhile she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she\\r\\nowes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_,\\r\\nshe should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes\\r\\nnothing at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\\r\\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\\r\\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\\r\\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\\r\\nbe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall not be satisfied, unless\\r\\nhe comes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe may have a great deal of influence on some points,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\\r\\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of\\r\\nhis coming away from them to visit us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\\r\\ntea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\\r\\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\\r\\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and\\r\\nconvivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last\\r\\nthe drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very\\r\\ngood spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma\\r\\nwere sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, with\\r\\nscarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by\\r\\nthe expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\\r\\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\\r\\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\\r\\nfriendly smiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--her fair,\\r\\nlovely, amiable friend. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid she know?--had she heard any thing about\\r\\nher, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--he must\\r\\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\\r\\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror\\r\\nof a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he\\r\\nwere more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on\\r\\nHarriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\\r\\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\\r\\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\\r\\nagain, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\\r\\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\\r\\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\\r\\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\\r\\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing\\r\\nit--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\\r\\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\\r\\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston\\r\\nto implore her assistance, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould not she give him her support?--would\\r\\nnot she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\\r\\nto Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had\\r\\nno infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she\\r\\ngive him her influence in procuring it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo scrupulous for others,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand yet so careless for\\r\\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\\r\\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\\r\\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I\\r\\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\\r\\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of\\r\\nfirst interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and\\r\\noffended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.\\r\\nShe could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought\\r\\nmust restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a\\r\\nseat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\\r\\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\\r\\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\\r\\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing\\r\\nfast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\\r\\nsir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\\r\\nthrough a storm of snow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\\r\\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\\r\\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston\\r\\nand Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\\r\\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI admired your resolution very much, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin venturing out\\r\\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\\r\\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and\\r\\nI dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can\\r\\nhardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is\\r\\nblown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other\\r\\nat hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\r\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest\\r\\nit should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\\r\\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\\r\\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they\\r\\nwould find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, that\\r\\nhe might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\\r\\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\\r\\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\\r\\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\\r\\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some\\r\\ntime. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\\r\\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\\r\\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\\r\\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\\r\\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\\r\\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager\\r\\nto have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,\\r\\nwhile she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible\\r\\naccumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better order the carriage directly, my love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare\\r\\nsay we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we\\r\\ndo come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all\\r\\nafraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,\\r\\nyou know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that\\r\\ngives me cold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\r\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\\r\\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,\\r\\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\\r\\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\\r\\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\\r\\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\\r\\nleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,\\r\\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine,\\r\\nand could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their\\r\\ngetting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He\\r\\nhad gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow\\r\\nwas nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to\\r\\nwhiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the\\r\\nclouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon\\r\\nover. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there\\r\\nbeing nothing to apprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\\r\\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who\\r\\nwas immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\r\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\\r\\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\\r\\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning\\r\\nhome, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and\\r\\nwhile the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley\\r\\nand Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour father will not be easy; why do not you go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am ready, if the others are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I ring the bell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,\\r\\nand Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own\\r\\nhouse, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\\r\\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\\r\\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\\r\\nWeston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal\\r\\nof alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\\r\\ndiscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was\\r\\nafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\\r\\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\\r\\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\\r\\nas they could;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\\r\\nslow and wait for the other carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\\r\\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\\r\\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\\r\\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\\r\\nand that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have been\\r\\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\\r\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\\r\\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\\r\\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\\r\\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he\\r\\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\r\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\\r\\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they\\r\\npassed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her\\r\\nsubject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, and Mr. Elton\\r\\nactually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious\\r\\nopportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known,\\r\\nhoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; but\\r\\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\\r\\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\\r\\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\\r\\nreally was so. Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent\\r\\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\\r\\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\\r\\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\\r\\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\\r\\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\\r\\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\\r\\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\\r\\nreplied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\\r\\nyourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\\r\\nbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly\\r\\nmean!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such\\r\\nboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with\\r\\nquickness,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\\r\\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\\r\\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\\r\\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\\r\\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\\r\\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\\r\\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--but\\r\\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he\\r\\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\\r\\nfavourable answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\\r\\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\\r\\nreplied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\\r\\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\\r\\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\\r\\nmonth, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily\\r\\nhabit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an\\r\\nunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!\\r\\nBelieve me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object\\r\\nof such professions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Heaven!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Elton, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat can be the meaning of this?--Miss\\r\\nSmith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\\r\\nexistence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\\r\\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she\\r\\nhas fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\\r\\nsorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!\\r\\nwho can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\\r\\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\\r\\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\\r\\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\\r\\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You\\r\\ncannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be\\r\\ninsinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which\\r\\nof all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\\r\\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\\r\\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he\\r\\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\\r\\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit confesses no such thing. So far from having\\r\\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\\r\\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\\r\\nshould have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be farther\\r\\nfrom my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of\\r\\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\\r\\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not\\r\\nyour attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged\\r\\nill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have\\r\\nnever sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you\\r\\nhave never thought seriously of her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, affronted in his turn: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever, I assure you.\\r\\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of\\r\\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish\\r\\nher extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\\r\\nto--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\\r\\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\\r\\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, my\\r\\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I\\r\\nreceived--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEncouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\\r\\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\\r\\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\\r\\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\\r\\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\\r\\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\\r\\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\\r\\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\\r\\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\\r\\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\\r\\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\\r\\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\\r\\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\\r\\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\\r\\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\\r\\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\\r\\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\\r\\nsyllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\\r\\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\\r\\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who\\r\\nhad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\\r\\nLane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and in\\r\\nstrange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as\\r\\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\\r\\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\\r\\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\\r\\nfather, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\\r\\ngruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\\r\\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\\r\\nexcept herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\\r\\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the\\r\\nusual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\\r\\nand be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow\\r\\nof every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\\r\\nthing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\\r\\nof all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\\r\\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and\\r\\nshe would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in\\r\\nerror--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\\r\\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have\\r\\nborne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me--but poor\\r\\nHarriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHow she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never\\r\\nthought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as\\r\\nshe could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\\r\\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\\r\\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\\r\\nmisled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and the\\r\\ncharade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had\\r\\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cready\\r\\nwit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--but then the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoft eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--in fact it suited neither; it was\\r\\na jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\\r\\nthick-headed nonsense?\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\\r\\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\\r\\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\\r\\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\\r\\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\\r\\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\\r\\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\\r\\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\\r\\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\\r\\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,\\r\\nthe conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\\r\\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\\r\\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It\\r\\nwas dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\\r\\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\\r\\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\\r\\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\\r\\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\\r\\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\\r\\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\\r\\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was\\r\\nperfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be\\r\\ncared for. There had been no real affection either in his language or\\r\\nmanners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\\r\\nhardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less\\r\\nallied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He\\r\\nonly wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\\r\\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\\r\\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\\r\\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\\r\\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\\r\\nhim!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down\\r\\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\\r\\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\\r\\npresumption in addressing her!--It was most provoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\\r\\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\\r\\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\\r\\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must\\r\\nknow that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\\r\\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the\\r\\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\\r\\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\\r\\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\\r\\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\\r\\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had\\r\\nlong held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\\r\\nMr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he\\r\\ncould, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him\\r\\nto notice but his situation and his civility.--But he had fancied her\\r\\nin love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\\r\\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\\r\\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop\\r\\nand admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\\r\\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\\r\\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\\r\\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\\r\\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\\r\\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\\r\\nhers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\\r\\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\\r\\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what\\r\\nought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\\r\\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere have I,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactually talked poor Harriet into being very\\r\\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\\r\\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\\r\\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\\r\\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not\\r\\nto accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\\r\\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\\r\\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\\r\\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\\r\\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\\r\\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel this\\r\\ndisappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body\\r\\nelse who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I\\r\\ncould not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more\\r\\nserious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,\\r\\nand must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and\\r\\nall that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of\\r\\nfuture meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the\\r\\nacquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding\\r\\neclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some\\r\\ntime longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the\\r\\nconviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary\\r\\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\\r\\nspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\\r\\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\\r\\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\\r\\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\\r\\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\\r\\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in\\r\\nlove with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\\r\\ndisappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior\\r\\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there\\r\\ncould be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the\\r\\nthree principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment's\\r\\nuneasiness about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow\\r\\non the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that\\r\\nmight justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\\r\\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\\r\\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\\r\\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\\r\\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\\r\\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\\r\\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\\r\\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse\\r\\nwith Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any\\r\\nmore than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's\\r\\nabsenting himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though\\r\\nshe hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society\\r\\nor other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with\\r\\nhis being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to\\r\\nhear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from\\r\\nthem,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\\r\\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\\r\\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to\\r\\nhis companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\\r\\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the\\r\\nrest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging,\\r\\nand speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of\\r\\ncheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such\\r\\nan evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as\\r\\nmade it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\\r\\nweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\\r\\nbehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party\\r\\nset off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\\r\\nIsabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\\r\\non, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\\r\\nbusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\\r\\nElton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\\r\\nMr. Elton's best compliments, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he was proposing to leave Highbury\\r\\nthe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with\\r\\nthe pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\\r\\nweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\\r\\nvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\\r\\nleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\\r\\nretain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\\r\\nhappy to attend to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this\\r\\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\\r\\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\\r\\nwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\\r\\nin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\\r\\nShe had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not\\r\\nmentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\\r\\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as\\r\\nshe thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\\r\\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to\\r\\nthe end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a\\r\\nvery useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\\r\\nand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\\r\\ntalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\\r\\nwith all her usual promptitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\\r\\nto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that\\r\\nshe should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\\r\\nher other complaint before the gentleman's return. She went to Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\\r\\npenance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She had to destroy\\r\\nall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear in\\r\\nthe ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself\\r\\ngrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\\r\\nher observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\\r\\nsix weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight of\\r\\nHarriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\\r\\nherself again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every\\r\\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\\r\\nof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\\r\\nher friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\\r\\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\\r\\nHarriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\\r\\nany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\\r\\nwould have been too great a distinction.--She never could have deserved\\r\\nhim--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\\r\\nhave thought it possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, that\\r\\nno dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--and\\r\\nshe listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\\r\\nunderstanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\\r\\nsuperior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be more for\\r\\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\\r\\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\\r\\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\\r\\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was\\r\\nto promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection\\r\\nin some better method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield,\\r\\nand shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and\\r\\namuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and\\r\\nshe could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\\r\\ngeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton\\r\\nin particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,\\r\\nand with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be\\r\\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as\\r\\nto allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,\\r\\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\\r\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,\\r\\nprove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet\\r\\nit appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\\r\\ninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend its\\r\\ncontinuing very long in equal force.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\\r\\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\\r\\nimagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\\r\\nrecollection of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\\r\\neach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\\r\\neffecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\\r\\nother, and make the best of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\\r\\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\\r\\nhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\\r\\nrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\\r\\nfound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\\r\\ncure, there could be no true peace for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.\\r\\nWeston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For\\r\\nthe present, he could not be spared, to his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery great mortification\\r\\nand regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to\\r\\nRandalls at no distant period.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in\\r\\nfact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\\r\\nhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\\r\\nexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\\r\\nany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\\r\\nand begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\\r\\nsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three\\r\\nmonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year;\\r\\nbetter weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\\r\\nconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of\\r\\na more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\\r\\nexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\\r\\nto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.\\r\\nFrank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.\\r\\nThe acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to\\r\\nbe quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she\\r\\nshould appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express\\r\\nas much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their\\r\\nfriendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\\r\\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\\r\\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\\r\\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\\r\\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\\r\\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\\r\\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\\r\\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\\r\\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\\r\\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\\r\\nuse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Churchills are very likely in fault,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I dare say he might come if he would.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but\\r\\nhis uncle and aunt will not spare him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\\r\\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose\\r\\nhim such an unnatural creature?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that\\r\\nhe may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little\\r\\nfor any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have\\r\\nalways set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than\\r\\none could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud,\\r\\nluxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If\\r\\nFrank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it\\r\\nbetween September and January. A man at his age--what is he?--three or\\r\\nfour-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.\\r\\nIt is impossible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\\r\\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\\r\\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\\r\\nto manage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\\r\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\\r\\nmoney--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\\r\\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in\\r\\nthe kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. A\\r\\nlittle while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the\\r\\nChurchills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sometimes he can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\\r\\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\\r\\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\\r\\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\\r\\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\\r\\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at\\r\\nothers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\\r\\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\\r\\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his\\r\\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\\r\\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\\r\\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--'Every sacrifice of\\r\\nmere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;\\r\\nbut I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by\\r\\nmy failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion.\\r\\nI shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--If he would say so to her\\r\\nat once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\\r\\nopposition made to his going.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, laughing; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut perhaps there might be some made to his\\r\\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\\r\\nuse!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\\r\\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to\\r\\nyour own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\\r\\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\\r\\nhim!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\\r\\nloud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDepend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He\\r\\nwould feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, of course,\\r\\nas a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do him more\\r\\ngood, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he\\r\\ndepended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.\\r\\nRespect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could\\r\\ntrust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do\\r\\nrightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the\\r\\nworld must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and\\r\\nwhile meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not\\r\\nthinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for\\r\\nright conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of\\r\\nmanner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would\\r\\nbend to his.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\\r\\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have\\r\\na knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great\\r\\nones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be\\r\\ntransported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation,\\r\\nyou would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for\\r\\nhim; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have\\r\\na word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early\\r\\nobedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might\\r\\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set\\r\\nall their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as\\r\\nstrong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so\\r\\nequal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\\r\\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\\r\\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\\r\\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\\r\\nlife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\\r\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\\r\\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\\r\\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\\r\\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\\r\\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\\r\\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\\r\\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\\r\\nwould have been no difficulty now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall never agree about him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut that is nothing\\r\\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\\r\\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\\r\\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\\r\\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's\\r\\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\\r\\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and\\r\\nof leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\\r\\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\\r\\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\\r\\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\\r\\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right to\\r\\ncomplain. His letters disgust me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy\\r\\na woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's\\r\\nplace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her\\r\\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\\r\\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\\r\\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether\\r\\nhe did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\\r\\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\\r\\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,\\r\\nnot in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be\\r\\nvery agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings\\r\\nof other people: nothing really amiable about him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem determined to think ill of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!--not at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not\\r\\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits\\r\\nas any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal;\\r\\nthat he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\\r\\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\\r\\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\\r\\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\\r\\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of\\r\\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\\r\\nof nobody else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\\r\\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\\r\\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\\r\\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\\r\\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\\r\\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects\\r\\nwhich will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as\\r\\npropriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my\\r\\nidea of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd mine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley warmly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis, that if he turn out any\\r\\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\\r\\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--the\\r\\npractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make\\r\\nevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\\r\\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\\r\\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not\\r\\nendure such a puppy when it came to the point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will say no more about him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou turn every thing to\\r\\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\\r\\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrejudiced! I am not prejudiced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\\r\\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be\\r\\nangry.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\\r\\ndifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\\r\\nmind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\\r\\nhigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had\\r\\nnever before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit\\r\\nof another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVOLUME II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's\\r\\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\\r\\nnot think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and\\r\\nshe was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\\r\\nreturned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\\r\\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and\\r\\nreceiving no other answer than a very plaintive--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton is so good\\r\\nto the poor!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she found something else must be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\\r\\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\\r\\nalways sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\\r\\nloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\\r\\nwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\\r\\nthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\\r\\ntheir scanty comforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\\r\\nas to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\r\\nof its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--and\\r\\nall the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\\r\\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore\\r\\nshe seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not\\r\\npassing their door without going in--observing, as she proposed it to\\r\\nHarriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite\\r\\nsafe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\\r\\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\\r\\nwhich was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even\\r\\ngratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was\\r\\nseated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready\\r\\nto overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,\\r\\nsolicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's\\r\\nhealth, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake from\\r\\nthe beaufet--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten\\r\\nminutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and _she_ had\\r\\ntaken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much;\\r\\nand, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them\\r\\nthe favour to eat a piece too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\\r\\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\\r\\nsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\\r\\nletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\\r\\nhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went,\\r\\nand how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went\\r\\nthrough it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation\\r\\nthat could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's\\r\\nbeing obliged to say a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\\r\\nhaving once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\\r\\nany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses\\r\\nand Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not been\\r\\nprepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually\\r\\nhurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to\\r\\nthe Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--Mrs. Cole\\r\\nwas telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--Mrs. Cole was so\\r\\nkind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as\\r\\nshe came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a\\r\\nfavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to\\r\\nshew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much\\r\\nas any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying,\\r\\n'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her\\r\\ntime for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we\\r\\nhad a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body\\r\\nmore surprized. 'Have you, upon your honour?' said she; 'well, that is\\r\\nquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\\r\\nhope she is well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you. You are so kind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the happily deceived aunt, while\\r\\neagerly hunting for the letter.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! here it is. I was sure it could\\r\\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being\\r\\naware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately\\r\\nthat I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.\\r\\nCole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for\\r\\nit is such a pleasure to her--a letter from Jane--that she can never\\r\\nhear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,\\r\\nonly just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear\\r\\nwhat she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to\\r\\nJane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you\\r\\nsee--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses\\r\\nhalf. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often\\r\\nsays, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I think\\r\\nyou will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,\\r\\nma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out\\r\\nherself, if she had nobody to do it for her--every word of it--I am sure\\r\\nshe would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed,\\r\\nthough my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see\\r\\namazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such\\r\\na blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says,\\r\\nwhen she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong\\r\\neyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I\\r\\nonly wish my eyes may last me as well.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\\r\\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\\r\\nFairfax's handwriting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are extremely kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou who\\r\\nare such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is\\r\\nnobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.\\r\\nMy mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n addressing her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say\\r\\nabout Jane's handwriting?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\\r\\ntwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\\r\\npondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\\r\\nrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost\\r\\nresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\\r\\nBates turned to her again and seized her attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all. By\\r\\nonly raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\\r\\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\\r\\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\\r\\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all\\r\\ndeafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my\\r\\nmother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since\\r\\nshe was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as\\r\\nI was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her\\r\\nnow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes; next week.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\\r\\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\\r\\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\\r\\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\\r\\nCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very\\r\\ngood of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh\\r\\nyes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That is\\r\\nthe reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the\\r\\ncommon course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or\\r\\nWednesday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\\r\\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\\r\\nfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\\r\\nmother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at\\r\\nleast. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\\r\\npleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are\\r\\ngoing to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come\\r\\nover and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the\\r\\nsummer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for till she married,\\r\\nlast October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must\\r\\nmake it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\\r\\nbut however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\\r\\nto her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but\\r\\nwe shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as\\r\\nwell as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would\\r\\ngive them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country\\r\\nseat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great\\r\\ndeal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she ever\\r\\nheard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know,\\r\\nthat he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his\\r\\naddresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for\\r\\nColonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's\\r\\nnot walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all\\r\\nblame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss\\r\\nCampbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\\r\\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had\\r\\ntaken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane\\r\\nwas quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's\\r\\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the\\r\\nnot going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\\r\\ndiscovery,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\\r\\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\\r\\nbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\\r\\nexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\\r\\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\\r\\ndistance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was\\r\\nto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\\r\\nher (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\\r\\nCampbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\\r\\nthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\\r\\nMr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is\\r\\na most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\\r\\nWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the\\r\\nsudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have\\r\\nbeen dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he\\r\\nhad not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\\r\\n(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the\\r\\nhistory of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeing\\r\\nIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\\r\\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\\r\\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\\r\\nair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\\r\\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has\\r\\nno remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\\r\\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\\r\\nThere is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely\\r\\nplain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,\\r\\n(as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long\\r\\ntime, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned\\r\\nit before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\\r\\nconsiderate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\\r\\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\\r\\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\\r\\nmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her--and it is certainly a great\\r\\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\\r\\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\\r\\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will\\r\\nfind from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\\r\\nwhat a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\\r\\nher illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\\r\\nlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\\r\\nme, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through\\r\\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\\r\\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\\r\\nto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\\r\\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\\r\\nburst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--which\\r\\nmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\\r\\nat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\\r\\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\\r\\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\\r\\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\\r\\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\\r\\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\\r\\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and\\r\\nfamily to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I\\r\\nhave just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to\\r\\nher letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better\\r\\nthan I can tell it for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid we must be running away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\\r\\nand beginning to rise--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father will be expecting us. I had no\\r\\nintention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\\r\\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\\r\\npass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\\r\\npleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\\r\\nmorning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained\\r\\nthe street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\\r\\nagainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\\r\\nJane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ----regiment of infantry,\\r\\nand Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope\\r\\nand interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\\r\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under\\r\\nconsumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\\r\\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation,\\r\\nthe foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every\\r\\nprobability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught\\r\\nonly what very limited means could command, and growing up with no\\r\\nadvantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\\r\\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\\r\\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\\r\\nto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\\r\\nFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\\r\\nfarther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\\r\\ncamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\\r\\nhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\\r\\ndeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in\\r\\nhis power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice\\r\\nof her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about\\r\\nJane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and\\r\\ngrowing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his\\r\\ndaughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real\\r\\nfriend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking\\r\\nthe whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period\\r\\nJane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them\\r\\nentirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\\r\\nvery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\\r\\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel\\r\\nCampbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was\\r\\nhandsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's;\\r\\nbut, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of\\r\\nrespectable subsistence hereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, known\\r\\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\\r\\neducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,\\r\\nher heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline\\r\\nand culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every\\r\\nlighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of\\r\\nfirst-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy\\r\\nof all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was,\\r\\nas far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\\r\\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too\\r\\nmuch beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,\\r\\nand the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was\\r\\neasy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with\\r\\nthem, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of\\r\\nan elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with\\r\\nonly the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own\\r\\ngood understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\\r\\nCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from\\r\\nthe circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and\\r\\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\\r\\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the\\r\\nparents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the\\r\\nmarriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often\\r\\ndefies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is\\r\\nmoderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of\\r\\nMr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were\\r\\nacquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had\\r\\nyet her bread to earn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\\r\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\r\\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\\r\\nfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\r\\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had\\r\\nresolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from\\r\\nall the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace\\r\\nand hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\\r\\na resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\\r\\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for\\r\\ntheir own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would\\r\\nbe selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they\\r\\nbegan to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the\\r\\ntemptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments\\r\\nof ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,\\r\\naffection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying\\r\\non the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of\\r\\ntheir daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered\\r\\nher usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so\\r\\nfar from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,\\r\\nseemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something\\r\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\r\\ntolerable comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\\r\\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths\\r\\nnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\\r\\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\\r\\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\\r\\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or\\r\\ntreble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they\\r\\ndepended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery\\r\\nof her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she was to\\r\\ncome; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\r\\nhad been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the\\r\\npresent with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two\\r\\nyears' absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\\r\\nthrough three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,\\r\\nand less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\\r\\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\\r\\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\\r\\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly\\r\\nrefuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which\\r\\nher conscience could not quite acquit her. But \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe could never get\\r\\nacquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such\\r\\ncoldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or\\r\\nnot--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made\\r\\nsuch a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that\\r\\nthey were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every\\r\\nbody had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These were her\\r\\nreasons--she had no better.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\\r\\nby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\\r\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\\r\\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\\r\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\\r\\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane\\r\\nFairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the\\r\\nhighest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost\\r\\nevery body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her\\r\\nfigure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between\\r\\nfat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point\\r\\nout the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and\\r\\nthen, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether\\r\\nthan she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing\\r\\nbeauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had\\r\\nnever been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to\\r\\ncavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really\\r\\nneeded no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was\\r\\nthe reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her\\r\\nprinciples, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,\\r\\nshe saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,\\r\\nand merit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\\r\\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\\r\\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\\r\\nshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\\r\\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was\\r\\ngoing to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\\r\\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\\r\\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\\r\\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\\r\\nso naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\\r\\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\\r\\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's\\r\\nactions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination\\r\\nhad suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,\\r\\nsuccessless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously\\r\\nsucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her\\r\\nfriend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be\\r\\ndenying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself\\r\\neffectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of\\r\\nlaborious duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\r\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\\r\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she\\r\\ncould wish to scheme about for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed\\r\\nherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,\\r\\nor done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than\\r\\nsaying to Mr. Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe certainly is handsome; she is better than\\r\\nhandsome!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother\\r\\nand aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.\\r\\nFormer provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more\\r\\ntiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration\\r\\nof her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how\\r\\nlittle bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice\\r\\nof mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new\\r\\nworkbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.\\r\\nThey had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise\\r\\nwhich necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an\\r\\nair of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\r\\nsuperior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so\\r\\ncold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in\\r\\na cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was\\r\\ndisgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on\\r\\nthe subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent\\r\\non giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value\\r\\nfor his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all\\r\\ngeneral approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.\\r\\nIt did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw\\r\\nits artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_\\r\\nsomething more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,\\r\\nhad been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only\\r\\nto Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\\r\\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\\r\\nlittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\\r\\nprocure as to what he truly was. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas he handsome?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe believed\\r\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas he agreeable?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was\\r\\ngenerally thought so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid he appear a sensible young man; a young\\r\\nman of information?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt a watering-place, or in a common London\\r\\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\\r\\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\\r\\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\\r\\nmanners pleasing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emma could not forgive her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\\r\\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\r\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\\r\\nexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\\r\\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough\\r\\nto be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to\\r\\nJane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very pleasant evening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\\r\\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\\r\\nswept away;--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\\r\\nvery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting\\r\\nat one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;\\r\\nsometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss\\r\\nFairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing\\r\\nundone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\\r\\nat her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am happy you approved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, smiling; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I hope I am not\\r\\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father instantly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_that_ I am sure you are not.\\r\\nThere is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,\\r\\nyou are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed\\r\\nround once, I think it would have been enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are not often\\r\\ndeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\\r\\nthink you understand me, therefore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn arch look expressed--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand you well enough;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but she said\\r\\nonly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Fairfax is reserved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all\\r\\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\\r\\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou think her diffident. I do not see it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Emma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\\r\\nevening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and\\r\\namused to think how little information I obtained.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am disappointed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his only answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope every body had a pleasant evening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\\r\\nquiet way. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\\r\\nmoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\\r\\nMiss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\\r\\nshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\\r\\nBates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\\r\\nFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a\\r\\nvery well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\\r\\nagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\\r\\npresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.\\r\\nI am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\\r\\nexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\\r\\nthoughts were on the Bates's, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\\r\\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can\\r\\nventure to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we\\r\\nhave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\\r\\nit is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other\\r\\npork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\\r\\nof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without\\r\\nthe smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast\\r\\npork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\\r\\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and\\r\\nthe loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\\r\\nthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\\r\\nis not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\\r\\nboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\\r\\nlittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley presently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a piece of news for you.\\r\\nYou like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\\r\\ninterest you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNews! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile\\r\\nso?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had time only to say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when the door was\\r\\nthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\\r\\nof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.\\r\\nMr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another\\r\\nsyllable of communication could rest with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I\\r\\ncome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You\\r\\nare too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\\r\\nmarried.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\\r\\ncompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\\r\\nlittle blush, at the sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\\r\\nhad passed between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut where could _you_ hear it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere could you\\r\\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\\r\\nreceived Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least\\r\\nten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I\\r\\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was\\r\\nstanding in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so\\r\\nafraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would\\r\\ngo down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I think\\r\\nyou have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--'Oh!\\r\\nmy dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss\\r\\nHawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nhow could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told\\r\\nMrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\\r\\nread Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\\r\\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\\r\\nmother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\\r\\nthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe consider our Hartfield pork,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Woodhouse--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cindeed it\\r\\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot\\r\\nhave a greater pleasure than--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\\r\\nto us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\\r\\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\\r\\nWe may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\nHere was a sly glance at Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had been so fortunate as to--I forget\\r\\nthe precise words--one has no business to remember them. The information\\r\\nwas, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By\\r\\nhis style, I should imagine it just settled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton going to be married!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe will have every body's wishes for his happiness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is very young to settle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had\\r\\nbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\\r\\nwere always glad to see him at Hartfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bates, joyfully;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to have the poor old\\r\\nVicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have\\r\\nnever seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\\r\\noccupy her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, starting on this appeal;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cis he--is he a tall man?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho shall answer that question?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father would say\\r\\n'yes,' Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\\r\\nhappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\\r\\nyou will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\\r\\nHighbury, both in person and mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\\r\\nman--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he\\r\\nwas precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an\\r\\nexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother--wanting\\r\\nher to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\\r\\nmother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does not\\r\\nhear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\\r\\nfancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she says it did\\r\\nhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\\r\\nAnd Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\\r\\nis such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do.\\r\\nNow, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\\r\\nsuch very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a\\r\\nhappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning\\r\\nto Mr. Woodhouse, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think there are few places with such society as\\r\\nHighbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear\\r\\nsir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is\\r\\npork--a roast loin of pork--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\\r\\nwith her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it\\r\\ncannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\\r\\nEmma said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interest\\r\\nin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late\\r\\non these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\\r\\nCampbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\\r\\nElton and Miss Hawkins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I have seen Mr. Elton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say I shall be\\r\\ninterested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\\r\\nmonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\\r\\noff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Miss Bates, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfour weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\\r\\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that\\r\\nI ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said, 'No, Mr.\\r\\nElton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do not think I am\\r\\nparticularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.\\r\\nWhat is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if\\r\\nMr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so\\r\\ngood-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the world. How does\\r\\nMiss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you\\r\\nknow I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in\\r\\nperson--tall, and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\\r\\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\\r\\nnot, strictly speaking, handsome?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHandsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he was\\r\\nplain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\\r\\nand that you yourself--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,\\r\\nI always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\\r\\ngeneral opinion, when I called him plain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does\\r\\nnot look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my\\r\\ndear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most\\r\\nagreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's;\\r\\nbut I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home\\r\\ndirectly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the\\r\\nbetter for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\\r\\nattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for\\r\\nany thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be another\\r\\nthing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming\\r\\ntoo. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be\\r\\nso kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good\\r\\nmorning to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\\r\\nhe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to\\r\\nmarry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own view\\r\\nof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\\r\\nof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she\\r\\nwas sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope\\r\\nwas, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing\\r\\nit abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was likely\\r\\nto call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its\\r\\nbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would\\r\\nbe detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would\\r\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\\r\\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\\r\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, what do you think has happened!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which instantly burst forth,\\r\\nhad all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was\\r\\ngiven, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in\\r\\nlistening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to\\r\\ntell. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she had\\r\\nbeen afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down\\r\\nevery moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she\\r\\nhad hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the\\r\\nhouse where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she\\r\\nwould just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem\\r\\nto stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\\r\\nand she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as\\r\\nshe could, and took shelter at Ford's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Ford's was the principal\\r\\nwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop\\r\\nfirst in size and fashion in the place.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so, there she had\\r\\nset, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,\\r\\nperhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was\\r\\nso very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, but\\r\\nElizabeth Martin and her brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I\\r\\nthought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting\\r\\nnear the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy\\r\\nwith the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,\\r\\nand took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the\\r\\nshop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\\r\\nI am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away\\r\\nyou know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the\\r\\nworld but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he\\r\\nlooked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they\\r\\nbegan whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and\\r\\nI could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do\\r\\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came\\r\\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\\r\\nif I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I\\r\\ncould see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very\\r\\nfriendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no\\r\\nmore what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she\\r\\nwas sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to\\r\\nhold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting\\r\\naway--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me\\r\\ntoo--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\\r\\nso he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling\\r\\ndreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and\\r\\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\\r\\nthree yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was\\r\\ngoing to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's\\r\\nstables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!\\r\\ndear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was\\r\\nvery much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went\\r\\nback to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but\\r\\nI hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\\r\\nI would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,\\r\\nthere was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and\\r\\nso kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and\\r\\nmake me comfortable again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\\r\\nher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\\r\\ncomfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed\\r\\nthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\\r\\ndescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection\\r\\nand genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be\\r\\nwell-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make\\r\\nin the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of\\r\\ncourse, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition,\\r\\nas well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped\\r\\nto rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of\\r\\nHarriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what\\r\\nsignified her praise?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering\\r\\nall that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt\\r\\non,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might be distressing, for the moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you seem to\\r\\nhave behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,\\r\\nas a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould not think about it;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but still\\r\\nshe talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at\\r\\nlast, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry\\r\\non the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution;\\r\\nhardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only\\r\\namused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of\\r\\nMr. Elton's importance with her!\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\\r\\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour\\r\\nbefore, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation\\r\\nwas over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,\\r\\nwonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,\\r\\nwhich could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in\\r\\nher fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\\r\\nhad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any\\r\\ninfluence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\\r\\nat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\\r\\ncourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\\r\\nbrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth\\r\\nmight pass without their being thrown together again, with any\\r\\nnecessity, or even any power of speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\\r\\nsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\\r\\nbeing kindly spoken of.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in\\r\\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\\r\\nevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly\\r\\naccomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived\\r\\nto triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits,\\r\\nthere was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian\\r\\nname, and say whose music she principally played.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\\r\\nmortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\\r\\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\\r\\nlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\\r\\nhad gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged to another--and\\r\\nto another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\\r\\ncircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back gay\\r\\nand self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse,\\r\\nand defying Miss Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of\\r\\nperfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\\r\\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some\\r\\ndignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not\\r\\nthrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts;\\r\\nand he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of\\r\\nintroduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice;\\r\\nthe history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress\\r\\nof the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental\\r\\nrencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs.\\r\\nBrown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness and\\r\\nagitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so\\r\\nsweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,\\r\\nbeen so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally\\r\\ncontented.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and\\r\\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and\\r\\nhis own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed\\r\\nat--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young\\r\\nladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more\\r\\ncautiously gallant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\\r\\nplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\\r\\nwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\\r\\na certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he\\r\\nnext entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough\\r\\nto feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression\\r\\nof his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now\\r\\nspread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder\\r\\nthat she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so\\r\\ninseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that,\\r\\nexcept in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable\\r\\nhumiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured\\r\\nof never seeing him again. She wished him very well; but he gave\\r\\nher pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\\r\\ncertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\\r\\nprevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would\\r\\nbe an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\\r\\nwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enough\\r\\nfor Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome\\r\\nenough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion,\\r\\nthere Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted\\r\\nclaims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article,\\r\\ntruth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_\\r\\nshe was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not\\r\\nappear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name, no\\r\\nblood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters\\r\\nof a Bristol--merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole\\r\\nof the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it\\r\\nwas not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\\r\\nmoderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\\r\\nbut Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the\\r\\nfather and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law\\r\\nline--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than\\r\\nthat he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emma\\r\\nguessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.\\r\\nAnd all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder\\r\\nsister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great_\\r\\n_way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the\\r\\nhistory; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\\r\\ntalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\\r\\nof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's\\r\\nmind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\\r\\ncertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\\r\\nwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\\r\\nher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\\r\\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\\r\\nreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\\r\\nsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every\\r\\nday Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him,\\r\\n_just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have something\\r\\noccur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of\\r\\nsurprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about\\r\\nhim; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who\\r\\nsaw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as\\r\\nthe discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore, every\\r\\nguess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the\\r\\narrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and\\r\\nfurniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard was\\r\\nreceiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept\\r\\nalive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss\\r\\nHawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed\\r\\nattached!--his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his\\r\\nhat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\\r\\n\\r\\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\\r\\nfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,\\r\\nEmma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\\r\\npredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\\r\\nas a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of\\r\\nthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\\r\\nknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\\r\\nMartin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had\\r\\nnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written\\r\\nin the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great\\r\\ndeal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much\\r\\noccupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\\r\\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in\\r\\nperson, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were\\r\\nforgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again,\\r\\nEmma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best\\r\\nfor her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and\\r\\nwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\\r\\nAbsolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\\r\\nbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\\r\\nacquaintance--!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\\r\\nHarriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\\r\\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\\r\\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\\r\\nAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again\\r\\nso soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\r\\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\\r\\nof intimacy was chosen for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\\r\\nwhich her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely\\r\\nglossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\\r\\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her\\r\\nto the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\\r\\nPhilip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\\r\\nbeing lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where\\r\\nthe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\\r\\nand the direction, was consequently a blank.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\\r\\nput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\\r\\nespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\\r\\nhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\\r\\nrevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her\\r\\nto be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined\\r\\nher not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.\\r\\nShe went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who\\r\\nwas married, and settled in Donwell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\\r\\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\\r\\nunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\\r\\ngravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\\r\\nher seemingly with ceremonious civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\\r\\nfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\\r\\nunderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\\r\\nShe had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\\r\\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had\\r\\nbeen talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's\\r\\nsaying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had\\r\\nbrought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very\\r\\nroom she had been measured last September, with her two friends. There\\r\\nwere the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.\\r\\n_He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,\\r\\nthe party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same\\r\\nregrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they\\r\\nwere just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect,\\r\\nas ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage\\r\\nreappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness\\r\\nof it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given\\r\\nto those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months\\r\\nago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might\\r\\nresent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She\\r\\nwould have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\\r\\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\\r\\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\\r\\nhave done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. They must be\\r\\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much\\r\\nto herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\\r\\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to\\r\\nprocure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\\r\\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaster nor mistress was at home;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they had both been out some time; the\\r\\nman believed they were gone to Hartfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is too bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, as they turned away. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now we shall\\r\\njust miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\\r\\ndisappointed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\\r\\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being\\r\\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage\\r\\nstopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were\\r\\nstanding to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of\\r\\nthem, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston\\r\\nimmediately accosted her with,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad\\r\\nto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this\\r\\nmorning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is at\\r\\nOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\\r\\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\\r\\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\\r\\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\\r\\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\\r\\nwish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\\r\\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was\\r\\nby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not\\r\\nless to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was\\r\\nenough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in\\r\\ntheir joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.\\r\\nThe worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in\\r\\nthe rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now\\r\\nbe talked of no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\\r\\nallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command,\\r\\nas well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened,\\r\\nand smiled, and congratulated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, at the conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\\r\\nwife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had better move on, Mr. Weston,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are detaining the\\r\\ngirls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, I am ready;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and turning again to Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you must\\r\\nnot be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only\\r\\nhad _my_ account you know; I dare say he is really nothing\\r\\nextraordinary:\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\\r\\nspeaking a very different conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\\r\\nmanner that appropriated nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Mrs.\\r\\nWeston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\\r\\nfor her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Mr.\\r\\nWeston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\\r\\nEmma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\\r\\na different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\\r\\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\\r\\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\\r\\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--was a\\r\\nquestion, however, which did not augur much.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\\r\\nwas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful\\r\\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that\\r\\nshe was to think of her at four.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, dear anxious friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--said she, in mental soliloquy, while\\r\\nwalking downstairs from her own room, \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways overcareful for every\\r\\nbody's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\\r\\ngoing again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c'Tis twelve;\\r\\nI shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this\\r\\ntime to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\\r\\npossibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\\r\\nsoon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\\r\\nfather--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\\r\\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank's\\r\\nbeing a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his\\r\\nvery civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her\\r\\nshare of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually\\r\\nbefore her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had\\r\\nbeen said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young man; height,\\r\\nair, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great\\r\\ndeal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick and\\r\\nsensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was\\r\\na well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her\\r\\nthat he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted\\r\\nthey soon must be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\\r\\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\\r\\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you yesterday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you\\r\\nall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\\r\\nused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\\r\\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\\r\\nupon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\\r\\nmore than any little exertion it needs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the young\\r\\nman, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\\r\\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\\r\\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\\r\\nconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\\r\\nwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\\r\\nallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\\r\\nHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\\r\\nto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\\r\\none's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\\r\\nhe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\\r\\npassed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a\\r\\nfalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had\\r\\nno air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in a\\r\\nstate of no common enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\\r\\nacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas she a\\r\\nhorsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large\\r\\nneighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were\\r\\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was\\r\\nit a musical society?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\r\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\\r\\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\\r\\nmother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much\\r\\nwarm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his\\r\\nfather, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional\\r\\nproof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly thinking it\\r\\nworth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word of praise\\r\\nbeyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but,\\r\\nundoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood\\r\\nwhat would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis father's\\r\\nmarriage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chad been the wisest measure, every friend must\\r\\nrejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing\\r\\nmust be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,\\r\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\r\\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's\\r\\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if\\r\\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\\r\\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\\r\\nher person.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cElegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\\r\\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\\r\\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen with\\r\\npleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such\\r\\nwords. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty\\r\\nyoung woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I should know better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno, depend upon it, (with a\\r\\ngallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom\\r\\nI might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\\r\\nterms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\\r\\ntheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind,\\r\\nhad ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered\\r\\nas marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more\\r\\nof him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were\\r\\nagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\\r\\neye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\\r\\nexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was\\r\\nconfident that he was often listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\\r\\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\\r\\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\\r\\napproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting\\r\\nto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\\r\\nthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\\r\\nany two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\\r\\nwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\\r\\nnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\\r\\nglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\\r\\nhis natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\\r\\nFrank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\\r\\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\\r\\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,\\r\\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\\r\\nafter another night.\\r\\n\\r\\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must be going.\\r\\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for\\r\\nMrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His son,\\r\\ntoo well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\\r\\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\\r\\nmay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with\\r\\na neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\\r\\nHighbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\\r\\nI suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not\\r\\nthe proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\\r\\nfamily of that name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure we do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his father; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Bates--we passed her\\r\\nhouse--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted\\r\\nwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl\\r\\nshe is. Call upon her, by all means.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no necessity for my calling this morning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the young man;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9canother day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance\\r\\nat Weymouth which--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\\r\\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\\r\\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You saw\\r\\nher with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed\\r\\nwith, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough\\r\\nto live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son looked convinced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe is a very\\r\\nelegant young woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as inclined her almost to\\r\\ndoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\\r\\nof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\\r\\nonly ordinarily gifted with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and\\r\\nhear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an\\r\\naunt who never holds her tongue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen give\\r\\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\\r\\nlady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\\r\\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\\r\\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\\r\\nshew you the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\\r\\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\\r\\nhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\\r\\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\\r\\nhad best cross the street.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\\r\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy good friend,\\r\\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\\r\\nit, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\\r\\nstep, and jump.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\\r\\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained\\r\\nvery well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now\\r\\nengage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full\\r\\nconfidence in their comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had\\r\\nbeen sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till\\r\\nher usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,\\r\\nimmediately fixed on Highbury.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did not doubt there being very\\r\\npleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\\r\\nchuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\\r\\nwould be his constant attraction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\\r\\nfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with\\r\\nhim. They walked thither directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\\r\\nhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\\r\\nnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\\r\\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\\r\\narm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\\r\\ncompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\\r\\nwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\\r\\nfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\\r\\nwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his\\r\\nduty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to\\r\\nher--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as\\r\\na friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma\\r\\nto form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of\\r\\nthe morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour\\r\\nor two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards\\r\\nin Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield\\r\\nsufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was\\r\\nresolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole\\r\\nvillage, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than\\r\\nEmma could have supposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\\r\\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\\r\\nwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that\\r\\nan old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of\\r\\nher cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\\r\\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\\r\\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\\r\\nbe very like a merit to those he was with.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\\r\\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting\\r\\nhimself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of\\r\\ninsincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him\\r\\njustice.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\\r\\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\\r\\nwere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\\r\\nrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\\r\\nany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\\r\\nthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for\\r\\na ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\\r\\npopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such\\r\\nbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\\r\\nwhich it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\\r\\namong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\\r\\ninterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\\r\\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\\r\\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\\r\\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault\\r\\nin the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it\\r\\nwas long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\\r\\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\\r\\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived\\r\\nthe former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in\\r\\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\\r\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\\r\\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\\r\\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\\r\\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars\\r\\nwere given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that\\r\\nthe inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there\\r\\nwould be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their\\r\\nproper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent\\r\\non dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of\\r\\nthe Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.\\r\\nHe seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social\\r\\ninclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of\\r\\nEnscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his\\r\\nindifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of\\r\\nmind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\\r\\nIt was but an effusion of lively spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\\r\\nand being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\\r\\nrecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\\r\\npaid it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, oh! yes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was just going to mention it. A very\\r\\nsuccessful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\\r\\nobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\\r\\nme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\\r\\nwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\\r\\nwould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and\\r\\nI had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there\\r\\nwas no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,\\r\\nwhen he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had\\r\\nbeen actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.\\r\\nThe good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIll, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\\r\\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies\\r\\ncan never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\\r\\npale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A most\\r\\ndeplorable want of complexion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's\\r\\ncomplexion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was certainly never brilliant, but she would not\\r\\nallow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and\\r\\ndelicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of\\r\\nher face.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had\\r\\nheard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to him\\r\\nnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where\\r\\nfeatures were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;\\r\\nand where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not\\r\\nattempt to describe what the effect was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is no disputing about taste.--At least you\\r\\nadmire her except her complexion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head and laughed.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\\r\\ncomplexion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\\r\\ntheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\\r\\nsays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.\\r\\nIf it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\\r\\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\\r\\nbuy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say\\r\\nthey sell gloves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\\r\\nbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\\r\\nyou were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your\\r\\npopularity will stand upon your own virtues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMen's Beavers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYork Tan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\\r\\nsaid--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\\r\\nyou were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\\r\\n_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\\r\\npublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\\r\\nprivate life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\\r\\nparty at Weymouth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\\r\\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree\\r\\nof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--I\\r\\nshall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\\r\\nher account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\\r\\nreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\\r\\nbody, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance\\r\\nwith her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\\r\\nwell. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\\r\\nlittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\\r\\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\\r\\nwarm-hearted woman. I like them all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is\\r\\ndestined to be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston smiling;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cremember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\\r\\nwhen you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little\\r\\nfarther off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly do forget to think of _her_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas having ever\\r\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid\\r\\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank\\r\\nChurchill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEver hear her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou forget how much she belongs to\\r\\nHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\\r\\nShe plays charmingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\\r\\ncould really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\\r\\nconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I am\\r\\nexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right\\r\\nof judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her's\\r\\nadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a\\r\\nman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to\\r\\nher--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman\\r\\nto sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\\r\\ninstead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\\r\\nThat, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProof indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, highly amused.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Dixon is very musical,\\r\\nis he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\\r\\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\\r\\nvery strong proof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\\r\\nthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\\r\\nto me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear\\r\\nthan eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\\r\\nHow did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was her very particular friend, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor comfort!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, laughing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne would rather have a stranger\\r\\npreferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might\\r\\nnot recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\\r\\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor\\r\\nMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\\r\\nreally did not seem to feel it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But\\r\\nbe it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or\\r\\ndulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt\\r\\nit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\\r\\ndistinction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs to that--I do not--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's\\r\\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\\r\\nbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\\r\\nwas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chowever, it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might\\r\\nall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\\r\\noutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be\\r\\na better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\\r\\nherself in critical situations, than I can be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\\r\\nand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\\r\\nintimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\\r\\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\\r\\nlittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take\\r\\ndisgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was,\\r\\nby her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--I\\r\\nnever could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOftentimes very\\r\\nconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\\r\\nbut no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\\r\\nmay be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\\r\\nagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\\r\\nconquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\\r\\nFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\\r\\nill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual\\r\\ncautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\\r\\nabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to\\r\\nconceal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\\r\\nthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\\r\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was\\r\\nnot exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some\\r\\nof his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better\\r\\nthan she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate--his feelings\\r\\nwarmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr.\\r\\nElton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at,\\r\\nand would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not\\r\\nbelieve it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for\\r\\nhaving. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not\\r\\nthink any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample\\r\\nroom in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who\\r\\nwanted more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\\r\\nUsed only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\\r\\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no\\r\\njudge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma,\\r\\nin her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking\\r\\nabout, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in\\r\\nlife, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the\\r\\ninroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or\\r\\na bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe\\r\\ncould not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would\\r\\nwillingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\\r\\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have\\r\\nhis hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and\\r\\nhe had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,\\r\\nbut with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut.\\r\\nThere was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over\\r\\non such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it\\r\\nwhich she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of\\r\\nplan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,\\r\\nwhich she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,\\r\\nextravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be\\r\\ndoing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his\\r\\nfather and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear\\r\\nin general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only\\r\\ncalled him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.\\r\\nWeston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as\\r\\nquickly as possible, and making no other comment than that \\xe2\\x80\\x9call young\\r\\npeople would have their little whims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\\r\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston\\r\\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\\r\\nhimself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\\r\\nappeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and\\r\\nlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal\\r\\ndecidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of\\r\\ntalking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were\\r\\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\\r\\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\\r\\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\\r\\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\\r\\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\\r\\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,\\r\\nof being at least very near it, and saved only by her own\\r\\nindifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the\\r\\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\\r\\nhave some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\\r\\nextremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\\r\\nmuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\\r\\nharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call young people would have their\\r\\nlittle whims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\\r\\nleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of\\r\\nDonwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made\\r\\nfor the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so\\r\\noften and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be\\r\\nsoftened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.\\r\\nThe circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was\\r\\nsilent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,\\r\\nover a newspaper he held in his hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHum! just the trifling, silly\\r\\nfellow I took him for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's\\r\\nobservation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his\\r\\nown feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly\\r\\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma\\r\\nwant their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly\\r\\nthe advice they gave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in\\r\\nHighbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and\\r\\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,\\r\\nand only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,\\r\\nthey had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little\\r\\ncompany, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had\\r\\nbrought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had\\r\\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With\\r\\ntheir wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their\\r\\ninclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number\\r\\nof servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,\\r\\nin fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\\r\\nTheir love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\\r\\nfor their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the\\r\\nsingle men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma\\r\\ncould hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor\\r\\nHartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;\\r\\nand she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving\\r\\nher refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very\\r\\nrespectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not\\r\\nfor them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit\\r\\nthem. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from\\r\\nherself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\\r\\nbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\\r\\nvery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\\r\\ninvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\\r\\nWeston's accounting for it with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose they will not take the\\r\\nliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was not quite\\r\\nsufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\\r\\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,\\r\\nconsisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred\\r\\nagain and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted\\r\\nto accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They\\r\\nhad been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\\r\\nand Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might\\r\\nnot the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare\\r\\npossibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and\\r\\nher being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be\\r\\nintended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\\r\\nHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first\\r\\nremark, on reading it, was that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof course it must be declined,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she so\\r\\nvery soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their\\r\\nadvice for her going was most prompt and successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\\r\\nwithout inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\\r\\nproperly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much\\r\\nconsideration for her father. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey would have solicited the honour\\r\\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\\r\\nLondon, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\\r\\nair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\\r\\nof his company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\\r\\nbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting\\r\\nhis comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be\\r\\ndepended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked\\r\\ninto an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now\\r\\nnear at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_\\r\\ngoing, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be\\r\\ntoo late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not fond of dinner-visiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never was. No more is\\r\\nEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\\r\\nshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\\r\\nin one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us\\r\\nin their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\\r\\nreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\\r\\nevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\\r\\nbody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\\r\\nwith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take\\r\\ncare of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what\\r\\nit ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then turning to Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, with a look of gentle reproach--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Miss Taylor, if you had not\\r\\nmarried, you would have staid at home with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas I took Miss Taylor away, it is\\r\\nincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\\r\\nnot lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how\\r\\nto allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\\r\\narranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\\r\\nas usual. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard\\r\\nfor Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James\\r\\ncould take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written\\r\\nto Mrs. Cole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say\\r\\nthat I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline\\r\\ntheir obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.\\r\\nBut you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be\\r\\ndone. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be\\r\\nwanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never\\r\\nbeen there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have\\r\\nno doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,\\r\\nyou must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again;\\r\\nand you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late.\\r\\nYou will get very tired when tea is over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many\\r\\npeople talking at once. You will not like the noise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif Emma comes away early, it will\\r\\nbe breaking up the party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd no great harm if it does,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sooner every\\r\\nparty breaks up, the better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going\\r\\naway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\\r\\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must\\r\\nfeel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in\\r\\nthe room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am\\r\\nsure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\\r\\nbeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to\\r\\nyou for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\\r\\npain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\\r\\nnever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\\r\\nhe is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means\\r\\nof giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\\r\\nrather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\\r\\nlittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\\r\\nwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\\r\\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\\r\\nonly afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being\\r\\nexceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\\r\\nknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\\r\\nyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of\\r\\nthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\\r\\nup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,\\r\\nif she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\\r\\nhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\\r\\nsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\\r\\nthing were safe in the house, as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner\\r\\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\\r\\nfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection\\r\\nwhich could be concealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\\r\\ngood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\\r\\ndone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion\\r\\nof face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits.\\r\\nHe was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him,\\r\\nEmma thus moralised to herself:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things\\r\\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\\r\\nway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It\\r\\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\\r\\n_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\\r\\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or\\r\\nbeen ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of\\r\\na coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\\r\\nvanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for\\r\\na longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\\r\\ninference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\\r\\nhow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\\r\\nand of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\\r\\nnow seeing them together for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\\r\\nCole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\\r\\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\\r\\nhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\\r\\nthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\\r\\ndinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\\r\\ndress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\\r\\nthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\\r\\nunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\\r\\nthem to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner\\r\\nfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see\\r\\nthat it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\\r\\nhaving little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\\r\\nindependence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could,\\r\\nand not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\\r\\nShe had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\\r\\nher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is coming as you should do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike a gentleman.--I am\\r\\nquite glad to see you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thanked her, observing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow lucky that we should arrive at the same\\r\\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\\r\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You\\r\\nmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\\r\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\\r\\nbeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\\r\\nwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always\\r\\nobserve it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_ you have\\r\\nnothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You\\r\\nare not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall really\\r\\nbe very happy to walk into the same room with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsensical girl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his reply, but not at all in anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\\r\\nwith Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\\r\\nnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.\\r\\nWhen the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\\r\\nadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\\r\\nher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\\r\\nand at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed,\\r\\nnot without some dexterity on his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\\r\\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\\r\\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,\\r\\nthe lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\\r\\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already,\\r\\nat dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\\r\\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\\r\\nfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour.\\r\\nThe first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was\\r\\nthe name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of\\r\\nher that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found\\r\\nit well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,\\r\\nreceived an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been\\r\\ncalling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had\\r\\nbeen struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking\\r\\ninstrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\\r\\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\\r\\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations\\r\\non Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from\\r\\nBroadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and\\r\\nniece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,\\r\\nJane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\\r\\npossibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\\r\\nthat it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from\\r\\nColonel Campbell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne can suppose nothing else,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Mrs. Cole, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I was only\\r\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\\r\\nhad a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\\r\\nShe knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\\r\\nany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\\r\\nto surprize her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\\r\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\\r\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\\r\\nenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\\r\\nlisten to Mrs. Cole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\\r\\nmore satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\\r\\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite\\r\\na shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\\r\\ninstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves\\r\\na slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole,\\r\\nI really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\\r\\ngirls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\\r\\nit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\\r\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\\r\\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to\\r\\nMr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\\r\\nparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself\\r\\nin the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\\r\\nobliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\\r\\nreally is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure\\r\\nwe ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\\r\\nmay be prevailed with to try it this evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\\r\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned\\r\\nto Frank Churchill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do you smile?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, why do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich\\r\\nand so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rather wonder that it was never made before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--which must\\r\\nnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\\r\\nBates's house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your\\r\\n_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\r\\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\\r\\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\\r\\nthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\\r\\nbe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must\\r\\nknow as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and\\r\\nperhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young\\r\\nwoman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I\\r\\ntold you that your suspicions would guide mine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\\r\\nthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\\r\\njoint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you\\r\\nknow, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\\r\\nentertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\\r\\nof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either\\r\\nthat, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune\\r\\nto fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little\\r\\nattachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing\\r\\nexactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for\\r\\nher chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells\\r\\nto Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance;\\r\\nthere it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her\\r\\nnative air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might\\r\\nhave passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the\\r\\nmonths of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would\\r\\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare\\r\\nsay in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though\\r\\nyou make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what\\r\\nthey are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's\\r\\npreference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very\\r\\ndecided.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water\\r\\nparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did. I was there--one of the party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWere you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it\\r\\nseems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I should\\r\\nhave made some discoveries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\\r\\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught\\r\\nher.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and\\r\\nalarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was\\r\\nhalf an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too\\r\\ngeneral a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\\r\\nobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\\r\\ndiscoveries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share\\r\\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\\r\\nobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table\\r\\nwas again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly\\r\\nright, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know\\r\\na little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\\r\\nsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\\r\\nconclude it to come from the Campbells.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\\r\\nnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\\r\\nwould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\\r\\nconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\\r\\nDixon is a principal in the business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\\r\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\\r\\nyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\\r\\npaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\\r\\nBut when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it\\r\\nshould be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in\\r\\nno other light than as an offering of love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed\\r\\nreal; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects\\r\\ntook their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert\\r\\nsucceeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the\\r\\nusual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright\\r\\nsilly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the\\r\\nother--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,\\r\\nand heavy jokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\\r\\nladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\\r\\nof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\\r\\ndignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\\r\\nthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\\r\\ncheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\\r\\nalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\\r\\naffection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she\\r\\nhad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\\r\\nseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\\r\\nnothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\\r\\ndid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been\\r\\nglad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\\r\\nmortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\\r\\nvain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\\r\\nbeloved by the husband of her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\\r\\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\\r\\nsecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\\r\\nand therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\\r\\nsubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\\r\\nconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush\\r\\nof guilt which accompanied the name of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy excellent friend Colonel\\r\\nCampbell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\\r\\nby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\\r\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\\r\\nto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\\r\\nof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\\r\\nfair heroine's countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first\\r\\nof the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\\r\\nhandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\\r\\nand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\\r\\nwhere sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would\\r\\nnot sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.\\r\\nShe was his object, and every body must perceive it. She introduced him\\r\\nto her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard\\r\\nwhat each thought of the other. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had never seen so lovely a face, and\\r\\nwas delighted with her naivete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly to be sure it was paying\\r\\nhim too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a\\r\\nlittle like Mr. Elton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned\\r\\nfrom her in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\r\\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\\r\\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated\\r\\nsitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that his\\r\\nfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\\r\\nparish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\\r\\npleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,\\r\\nsensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it\\r\\nso abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she had been\\r\\nused to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the\\r\\nsociety in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,\\r\\nand the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as\\r\\nEnscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their\\r\\nvisitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and\\r\\nthat even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\\r\\nchance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\\r\\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though\\r\\nhe had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without\\r\\nconsiderable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away, or introduce\\r\\nan acquaintance for a night.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\\r\\nits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at\\r\\nhome than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did\\r\\nnot boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his\\r\\naunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing\\r\\nit, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could\\r\\n_with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which\\r\\nhis influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to\\r\\ngo abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she\\r\\nwould not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he said,\\r\\nhe was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\\r\\ngood behaviour to his father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have made a most wretched discovery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, after a short pause.--\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days fly\\r\\nso fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.\\r\\nBut just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the\\r\\nrecollection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\\r\\nof so few, in having your hair cut.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is no subject of regret at all. I have\\r\\nno pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\\r\\nseen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\\r\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When\\r\\nMr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,\\r\\nshe saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss\\r\\nFairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you for rousing me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe I have\\r\\nbeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\\r\\nway--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\\r\\nany thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own. I\\r\\nsee nobody else looking like her!--I must go and ask her whether it\\r\\nis an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you\\r\\nshall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\\r\\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\\r\\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\\r\\nfront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the luxury of a large party,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she:--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cone can get near\\r\\nevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk\\r\\nto you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\\r\\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\\r\\nMiss Bates and her niece came here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow?--They were invited, were not they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their\\r\\ncoming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey walked, I conclude. How else could they come?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\\r\\nit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\\r\\ncold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\\r\\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\\r\\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\\r\\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\\r\\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess\\r\\nhow readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made\\r\\nmy way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be\\r\\nat her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making\\r\\nher comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you\\r\\nmay be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,\\r\\nmany thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's\\r\\ncarriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite\\r\\nsurprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a\\r\\nvery kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing\\r\\nthat so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his\\r\\nusual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their\\r\\naccommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not\\r\\nhave had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse\\r\\nfor assisting them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery likely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing more likely. I know no man more\\r\\nlikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing\\r\\nreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\\r\\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\\r\\nFairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for\\r\\nan act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\\r\\nmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived\\r\\ntogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\\r\\ncould betray.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou give him credit for more simple,\\r\\ndisinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss\\r\\nBates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never\\r\\nbeen able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable\\r\\nit appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane\\r\\nFairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to\\r\\nit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Mrs. Weston, how\\r\\ncould you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must not\\r\\nmarry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,\\r\\nno, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's\\r\\nmarrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you\\r\\nshould think of such a thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want\\r\\nthe match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has\\r\\nbeen given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to\\r\\nmarry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six\\r\\nyears old, who knows nothing of the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.\\r\\nKnightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt\\r\\nit now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\\r\\nknow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the imprudence of such a match!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\\r\\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\\r\\nbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the\\r\\nBateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to\\r\\nshew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.\\r\\nYou do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,\\r\\nno;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so\\r\\nmad a thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cImprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\\r\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\\r\\nleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--He\\r\\nis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\\r\\nhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\\r\\nhis brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\\r\\nhis time or his heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves\\r\\nJane Fairfax--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am\\r\\nsure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps the greatest good he could\\r\\ndo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\\r\\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\\r\\nBates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\\r\\nhim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So very\\r\\nkind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'\\r\\nAnd then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old\\r\\npetticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still\\r\\nit would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that\\r\\ntheir petticoats were all very strong.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.\\r\\nAnd, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed\\r\\nby Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and\\r\\nif he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and\\r\\ndrown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad\\r\\nconnexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have\\r\\nheard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The\\r\\ninterest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that\\r\\nshe should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself\\r\\nso warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen\\r\\nto her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\\r\\nto me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though\\r\\nwe have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the\\r\\nCampbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting\\r\\nhim. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in\\r\\nlove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\\r\\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\\r\\nnothing mysteriously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener\\r\\nthan I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of\\r\\nthings, occur to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\\r\\nher so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong\\r\\nnotion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when\\r\\nMrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\\r\\nmany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--I\\r\\nbelieve nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that\\r\\nMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\\r\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most\\r\\nused of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them\\r\\nthat tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same\\r\\nmoment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the\\r\\nhonour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her\\r\\nconversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that\\r\\nhe had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very\\r\\npressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to\\r\\nlead, she gave a very proper compliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than\\r\\nshe could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in\\r\\nthe little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany\\r\\nher own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by\\r\\nsurprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her\\r\\npardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual\\r\\nfollowed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect\\r\\nknowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing\\r\\nof the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang\\r\\ntogether once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss\\r\\nFairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\\r\\nattempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\\r\\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\\r\\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\\r\\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\\r\\nEmma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\\r\\nMrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices\\r\\ngave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's\\r\\nmarrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil\\r\\nin it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;\\r\\nconsequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most\\r\\nmortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great\\r\\ndeduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could\\r\\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\\r\\nKnightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never\\r\\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\\r\\ntalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\\r\\nvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\\r\\nstruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\\r\\nkindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\\r\\nthe spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only\\r\\nhis disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI often feel concern,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I dare not make our carriage\\r\\nmore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but\\r\\nyou know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to\\r\\nfor such a purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite out of the question, quite out of the question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nreplied;--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you must often wish it, I am sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And he smiled with\\r\\nsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\\r\\nstep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis present from the Campbells,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis pianoforte is very\\r\\nkindly given.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, and without the smallest apparent\\r\\nembarrassment.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they would have done better had they given\\r\\nher notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\\r\\nenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\\r\\nexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\\r\\nhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were\\r\\nentirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual\\r\\npreference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's\\r\\nsecond song, her voice grew thick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou have\\r\\nsung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne more;--they would not\\r\\nfatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you could manage this\\r\\nwithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\\r\\nsong falls on the second.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, indignantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinks of nothing but shewing off\\r\\nhis own voice. This must not be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And touching Miss Bates, who at that\\r\\nmoment passed near--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\\r\\nherself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to\\r\\nbe grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\\r\\nsinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse\\r\\nand Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within\\r\\nfive minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew\\r\\nwhere--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every\\r\\nthing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,\\r\\ncapital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible\\r\\nwaltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to\\r\\nEmma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\\r\\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on\\r\\nher voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\\r\\nKnightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\\r\\nwere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\\r\\nsomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.\\r\\nCole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\\r\\nand he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\\r\\nshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\\r\\nfive couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of\\r\\nit made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\\r\\npartner. They were a couple worth looking at.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\\r\\ngrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's\\r\\naccount. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,\\r\\nthey were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it is as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\\r\\nher carriage. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\\r\\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\\r\\nafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\\r\\nmight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\\r\\nbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\\r\\nthe Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a\\r\\nname behind her that would not soon die away.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\\r\\npoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\\r\\ntransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\\r\\nJane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\\r\\nhad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission\\r\\nto all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made\\r\\nit difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her\\r\\ntongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\\r\\nthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the\\r\\ninferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\\r\\ngrieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised\\r\\nvigorously an hour and a half.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise\\r\\ncould have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's,\\r\\nthan a lamp is like sunshine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\\r\\nas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\\r\\nlast night said how well you played.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\\r\\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\\r\\nbut Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\\r\\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\\r\\nsaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal\\r\\nabout your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\\r\\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no\\r\\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\\r\\nknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\\r\\nteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\\r\\nany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as they always do--very vulgar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey told me something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet rather hesitatingly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is\\r\\nnothing of any consequence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\\r\\nproducing Mr. Elton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to\\r\\ndinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\\r\\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there\\r\\nagain next summer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\\r\\nbe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at\\r\\ndinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\\r\\ngirls in Highbury.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with\\r\\nher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\\r\\nher present state, would be dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\\r\\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\\r\\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\\r\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.\\r\\nPerry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\\r\\noffice-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\\r\\nstray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\\r\\ncould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with\\r\\nhis tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full\\r\\nbasket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling\\r\\nchildren round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she\\r\\nknew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough\\r\\nstill to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with\\r\\nseeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\\r\\nappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\\r\\nHighbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\\r\\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer\\r\\nRandalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\\r\\neye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\\r\\nagreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to\\r\\nthe present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call\\r\\non the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor my companion tells me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I absolutely promised Miss\\r\\nBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\\r\\nmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\\r\\nam going now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nFrank Churchill, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--if\\r\\nyou are going home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the\\r\\nway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always\\r\\nsends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to\\r\\ndo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am here on no business of my own,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am only waiting for\\r\\nmy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\\r\\nBut you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\\r\\nhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\\r\\nindifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\\r\\nWeston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be\\r\\npalatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world\\r\\nat a civil falsehood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe any such thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am persuaded that\\r\\nyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\\r\\nthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\\r\\notherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo come with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif it be not very disagreeable to\\r\\nyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\\r\\nWe will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\\r\\nwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\\r\\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,\\r\\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\\r\\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\\r\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\\r\\nit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\\r\\nlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShould I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs.\\r\\nFord.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at\\r\\nHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\\r\\nMrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown\\r\\nhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go\\r\\nto Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\\r\\nMrs. Ford, could not you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\\r\\nparcels.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo more it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo trouble in the world, ma'am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\\r\\nplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I\\r\\nthink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and\\r\\ntake it home with me at night. What do you advise?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\\r\\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, that will be much best,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet, quite satisfied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should\\r\\nnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVoices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\\r\\nWeston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the latter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am just run across to\\r\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\\r\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\\r\\ndo you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston\\r\\nto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\\r\\nand Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\\r\\nto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!\\r\\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\\r\\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\\r\\nvery happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\\r\\nrefuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's\\r\\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall\\r\\nbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said\\r\\nhe, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you\\r\\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\\r\\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet\\r\\ncame out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had\\r\\nno use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\\r\\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said\\r\\nso. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\\r\\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\\r\\nthen another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came\\r\\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,\\r\\nPatty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your\\r\\nmistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis\\r\\nsent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the\\r\\nWallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be\\r\\nuncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing\\r\\nbut the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value\\r\\nof our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?\\r\\nOnly three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats\\r\\nnothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened\\r\\nif you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I\\r\\nsay one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the\\r\\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so\\r\\nwell as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took\\r\\nthe opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet\\r\\nhim in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often\\r\\nheard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only\\r\\nway that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We\\r\\nhave apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent\\r\\napple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these\\r\\nladies will oblige us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and they did at\\r\\nlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\\r\\nI hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\\r\\ncame back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a\\r\\nlittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was I talking of?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, beginning again when they were all in\\r\\nthe street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's\\r\\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,\\r\\n'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\\r\\nexcessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\\r\\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\\r\\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\\r\\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....\\r\\n'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\\r\\nexcessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\\r\\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\\r\\nobliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothing\\r\\nin the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\\r\\nhome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so\\r\\nvery.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they\\r\\nare very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only\\r\\nwe do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us\\r\\npromise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so\\r\\ngood as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest\\r\\nsort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and\\r\\ncertainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his\\r\\ntrees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was\\r\\nalways famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the\\r\\nother day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating\\r\\nthese apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed\\r\\nthem, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I\\r\\nam sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for\\r\\nI have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me\\r\\nkeep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,\\r\\nbefore they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really\\r\\nas to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great\\r\\nmany left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept\\r\\nfor Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,\\r\\nso liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when\\r\\nhe was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say\\r\\nquarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite\\r\\ndistressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished\\r\\nI had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,\\r\\nI did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William\\r\\nLarkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of\\r\\napples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down\\r\\nand spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.\\r\\nWilliam Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see\\r\\nhim. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it\\r\\nwas all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them\\r\\nall--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did\\r\\nnot seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had\\r\\nsold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit\\r\\nthan any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their\\r\\nbeing all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be\\r\\nable to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid\\r\\nher not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for\\r\\nMrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks\\r\\nwere sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told\\r\\nme, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\\r\\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\\r\\nto keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\\r\\nbefore I was aware.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\\r\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\\r\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\\r\\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker\\r\\nand narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\\r\\nSmith, the step at the turning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\\r\\ntranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\\r\\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\\r\\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\\r\\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy\\r\\ncountenance on seeing Emma again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a pleasure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in rather a low voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoming at least\\r\\nten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\\r\\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave not you finished it yet? you would not\\r\\nearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not been working uninterruptedly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been\\r\\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\\r\\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\\r\\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be\\r\\npersuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\\r\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make\\r\\nher help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready\\r\\nto sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready,\\r\\nEmma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet\\r\\npossessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she\\r\\nmust reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not\\r\\nbut pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve\\r\\nnever to expose them to her neighbour again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\\r\\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\\r\\nWeston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma\\r\\njoined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\\r\\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Churchill, with a\\r\\nsmile at Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\\r\\nColonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\\r\\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\\r\\nparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\\r\\nfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you\\r\\nthink so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\\r\\nbeen speaking to her at the same moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not fair,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, in a whisper; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmine was a random guess. Do\\r\\nnot distress her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\\r\\ndoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this\\r\\noccasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder\\r\\nwhich will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to\\r\\nhand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going\\r\\nforward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence\\r\\nof an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only\\r\\na general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon\\r\\ncontingencies and conveniences?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTill I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, in a voice of\\r\\nforced calmness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\\r\\nall conjecture.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\\r\\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\\r\\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard\\r\\nat work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\\r\\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss\\r\\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the\\r\\npleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed\\r\\nfor the present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\\r\\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\\r\\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are very kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit will be one of the waltzes we\\r\\ndanced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\\r\\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\\r\\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever\\r\\nhas to give--for another half-hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe played.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\\r\\nhappy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something\\r\\nelse. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning\\r\\nto Emma, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here\\r\\nare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\\r\\nexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\\r\\nColonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\\r\\nhere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\\r\\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\\r\\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\\r\\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains\\r\\nof a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,\\r\\nthere had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the\\r\\namusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--This\\r\\namiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very\\r\\nreprehensible feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma\\r\\ntook the opportunity of whispering,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou speak too plain. She must understand you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\\r\\nashamed of my meaning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\\r\\na key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\\r\\nwrong, she ought to feel it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is not entirely without it, I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\\r\\nmoment--_his_ favourite.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\\r\\nKnightley on horse-back not far off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to\\r\\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\\r\\nbut I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come\\r\\nin when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\\r\\nso!--Our little room so honoured!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\\r\\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every\\r\\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as\\r\\nif it had passed within the same apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\\r\\nfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\\r\\nfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\\r\\nhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but\\r\\nparticularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold\\r\\nlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\\r\\nher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\\r\\nEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\\r\\nsteady scepticism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n resumed Miss Bates.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe cut her short with,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\\r\\nwanted something from Kingston.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.\\r\\nDo put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in a deliberating manner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor five minutes, perhaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\\r\\nso many friends!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\\r\\nto Kingston as fast as I can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the\\r\\npianoforte.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\\r\\nnight; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not\\r\\nit delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\\r\\nthing equal to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\\r\\nAnd (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\\r\\nnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\\r\\nWeston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,\\r\\nin England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\\r\\nsomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\\r\\nhear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so\\r\\nshocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had\\r\\na great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\\r\\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\\r\\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\\r\\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\\r\\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the\\r\\nroom,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is\\r\\ngoing to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\\r\\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\\r\\nhave heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you at\\r\\nKingston?' said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you\\r\\nbe going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\\r\\nlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived\\r\\nto be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\\r\\nallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\\r\\ngates, before they set off for Randalls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\\r\\nknown of young people passing many, many months successively, without\\r\\nbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\\r\\neither to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the\\r\\nfelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it\\r\\nmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\\r\\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\\r\\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\\r\\npeople in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his\\r\\nthe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the\\r\\ndifficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.\\r\\nBut still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how\\r\\ndelightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for\\r\\ndoing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane\\r\\nFairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked\\r\\naids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in\\r\\nto see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions\\r\\nof the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that\\r\\nMr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little\\r\\nthe largest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's\\r\\nshould be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\\r\\nand the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\\r\\nWeston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\\r\\nmost willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\\r\\nand the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who\\r\\nthere would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space\\r\\nto every couple.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\\r\\nCoxes five,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been repeated many times over. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd there will be the\\r\\ntwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\\r\\nYes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\\r\\nMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\\r\\ncouple there will be plenty of room.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\\r\\nthere will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn another,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\\r\\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\\r\\nIt will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\\r\\nthought of the moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and\\r\\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\\r\\nwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\\r\\nput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family\\r\\nof cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance\\r\\nwho could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple\\r\\nwould be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what\\r\\npossible manner they could be disposed of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight not\\r\\nthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It seemed the\\r\\nbest scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\\r\\nbetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about\\r\\nthe supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of\\r\\nhealth. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\\r\\npersevered in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\\r\\nbear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\\r\\nSo would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\\r\\nbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\\r\\nnot let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\\r\\nthoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\\r\\nthe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,\\r\\nand keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\\r\\ndraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\\r\\nquite the thing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of\\r\\nit, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\\r\\nclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\\r\\nin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\\r\\nFrank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before\\r\\nhad been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured\\r\\nto be made out quite enough for ten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were too magnificent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe allowed unnecessary room. Ten\\r\\ncouple may stand here very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma demurred. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be\\r\\nworse than dancing without space to turn in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he gravely replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was very bad.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But still he went on\\r\\nmeasuring, and still he ended with,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\\r\\nto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be\\r\\ndancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no denying it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI agree with you exactly. A crowd\\r\\nin a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures\\r\\nin a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having\\r\\nproceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be\\r\\na disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I am\\r\\nrather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\r\\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\\r\\ndancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\\r\\nHad she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\\r\\npause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\\r\\nand the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\\r\\nacquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\\r\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\\r\\nthe scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he almost immediately began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour inclination\\r\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\\r\\nof my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a\\r\\nthought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted\\r\\nupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\\r\\nof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\\r\\nCrown Inn?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Crown!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\\r\\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\\r\\nBetter accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\\r\\nwelcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no\\r\\nobjection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.\\r\\nOh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls\\r\\nrooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you\\r\\nwere the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_\\r\\nto like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you\\r\\nconsent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\\r\\nmyself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could\\r\\nbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\\r\\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\\r\\nnecessary to make it acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much\\r\\nworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\\r\\nnever properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\\r\\nhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown\\r\\nin his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a\\r\\nvery bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was going to observe, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Churchill, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat one of the\\r\\ngreat recommendations of this change would be the very little danger\\r\\nof any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at\\r\\nRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\\r\\nnobody else could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are very much mistaken\\r\\nif you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\\r\\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\\r\\nthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\\r\\noccasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it\\r\\nis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\\r\\nheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\\r\\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\\r\\nheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither\\r\\nyour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\\r\\nwindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have\\r\\noften known it done myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\\r\\nlive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\\r\\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\\r\\nover--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\\r\\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\\r\\nobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\\r\\ncan be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interrupted Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere will be plenty of time for talking every\\r\\nthing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\\r\\nthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be\\r\\nso near their own stable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\\r\\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\\r\\nbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be\\r\\ntrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\\r\\nunder Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\\r\\nis carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\\r\\nyears ago, when I had the measles? 'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\\r\\nwrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I\\r\\nheard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\\r\\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have\\r\\nbeen very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day\\r\\nfor a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which\\r\\nwas our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope\\r\\nwhenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for\\r\\nPerry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank\\r\\nChurchill, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexamining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\\r\\nand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\\r\\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\\r\\ndesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to\\r\\nthem, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\\r\\nsatisfactorily without you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\\r\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\\r\\nset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nWeston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\\r\\nvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,\\r\\nfinding every thing perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\\r\\nyou see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\\r\\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you are too particular,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her husband. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does all that\\r\\nsignify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\\r\\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\\r\\nclub-nights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMen never know\\r\\nwhen things are dirty or not;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to\\r\\nhimself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWomen will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\\r\\nIt regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,\\r\\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\\r\\nthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\\r\\nas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary\\r\\nby their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\\r\\nsupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\\r\\npurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\\r\\npassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\\r\\nWeston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;\\r\\nand neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\\r\\nmiserably crowded at supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\\r\\n&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\\r\\nsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\\r\\npronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and\\r\\nMrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\\r\\nexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through\\r\\nthe passage, was calling out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\\r\\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone could know which arrangement our guests\\r\\nin general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing\\r\\nmust be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Frank, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery true. You want your neighbours'\\r\\nopinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\\r\\nof them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\\r\\nupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I do not know\\r\\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\\r\\nthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.\\r\\nSuppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell--if you please,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you think\\r\\nshe will be of any use.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\r\\nwill be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\\r\\nwill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting\\r\\nMiss Bates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\\r\\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\\r\\nhis decided approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\\r\\nonce. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer\\r\\nperson for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.\\r\\nWe are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be\\r\\nhappy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth sir! Can the old lady?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great\\r\\nblockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\\r\\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\naway he ran.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\\r\\nand her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and\\r\\na good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it\\r\\nmuch less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here\\r\\nended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at\\r\\nleast, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\\r\\nchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\\r\\nas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\\r\\nStokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\\r\\nwritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\\r\\nwhich could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\\r\\nAs a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\\r\\ncharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general\\r\\nand minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\\r\\nhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,\\r\\nsome suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the\\r\\nfuture. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively\\r\\nsecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without\\r\\nher overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has asked her, my\\r\\ndear. That's right. I knew he would!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\\r\\nsatisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted\\r\\nterm of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's\\r\\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\\r\\nChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\\r\\nfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\\r\\ntheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\\r\\nentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\\r\\nhoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her opinion, the great risk, of\\r\\nits being all in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\\r\\nwish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.\\r\\nAll was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude\\r\\ngenerally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her\\r\\nball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking\\r\\nindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\\r\\nbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he\\r\\nseemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\\r\\nexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\\r\\nTo her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\\r\\nthan,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\\r\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\\r\\nagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,\\r\\nI must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as\\r\\nI can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's\\r\\nweek's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing\\r\\ndancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who\\r\\ndoes.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.\\r\\nThose who are standing by are usually thinking of something very\\r\\ndifferent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not\\r\\nin compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so\\r\\nindignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball,\\r\\nfor _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made\\r\\nher animated--open hearted--she voluntarily said;--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\\r\\nWhat a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\\r\\n_very_ great pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred\\r\\nthe society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and more convinced\\r\\nthat Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great\\r\\ndeal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no\\r\\nlove.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\\r\\ndays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\\r\\nevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew's\\r\\ninstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without\\r\\nhim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)\\r\\nwhen writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\\r\\nunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\\r\\nherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\\r\\nand must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\\r\\nwithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\\r\\nto lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but\\r\\nfor her own convenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he could only allow himself time to hurry to\\r\\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there\\r\\nwhom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\\r\\nexpected at Hartfield very soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had\\r\\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\\r\\nloss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man\\r\\nmight be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as\\r\\nit would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\\r\\nhappiest!--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said it would be so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the only consolation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\\r\\nMrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as\\r\\nfor the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they\\r\\nwould all be safer at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this\\r\\nreflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want\\r\\nof spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away\\r\\nalmost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\\r\\nsat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\\r\\nhimself, it was only to say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you will come again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will not be your only visit\\r\\nto Randalls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to\\r\\nreturn!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of\\r\\nall my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this\\r\\nspring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid it\\r\\nis a custom gone for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur poor ball must be quite given up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the\\r\\npleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\\r\\nfoolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\\r\\nwhy are you always so right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\\r\\nrather have been merry than wise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\\r\\non it. Do not forget your engagement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma looked graciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch a fortnight as it has been!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevery day more\\r\\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\\r\\nme less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\\r\\nHighbury!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you do us such ample justice now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will\\r\\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\\r\\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\\r\\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\\r\\ncoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\\r\\nwas convinced that it had been so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you must be off this very morning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\\r\\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\\r\\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have\\r\\nstrengthened yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\\r\\nwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\\r\\nby Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\\r\\nto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\\r\\nlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my\\r\\nvisit, then\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn short,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be\\r\\nquite without suspicion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\\r\\nwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\\r\\nserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in\\r\\nthe hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\\r\\nthen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\\r\\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\\r\\nhim sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\\r\\nHe could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\\r\\npassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to\\r\\nHartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more\\r\\nin love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\\r\\nhave ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\\r\\nsoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\\r\\nWeston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\\r\\nprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\\r\\nwas doubtful, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was time to go;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the young man, though he\\r\\nmight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall hear about you all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is my chief consolation.\\r\\nI shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\\r\\nMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\\r\\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\\r\\ninterested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In her letters\\r\\nI shall be at dear Highbury again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d closed the\\r\\nspeech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been\\r\\nthe notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry\\r\\nto part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his\\r\\nabsence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too\\r\\nmuch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\\r\\narrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to\\r\\nthe last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation\\r\\nof seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\\r\\nattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\\r\\nfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\\r\\ncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had\\r\\n_almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of\\r\\naffection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present\\r\\nshe could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious\\r\\npreference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,\\r\\nmade her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of\\r\\nevery previous determination against it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly must,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis sensation of listlessness,\\r\\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\\r\\nthis feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--\\r\\nI must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\\r\\nwere not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to\\r\\nothers. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank\\r\\nChurchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening\\r\\nwith his dear William Larkins now if he likes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say\\r\\nthat he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have\\r\\ncontradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he\\r\\nwas sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable\\r\\nkindness added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out\\r\\nof luck; you are very much out of luck!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\\r\\nregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure\\r\\nwas odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\\r\\nheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\\r\\ntaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\\r\\ncharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\\r\\nill-health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\\r\\nonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\\r\\ndeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\\r\\nFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\\r\\nin seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and\\r\\nquite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were\\r\\nhis spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to\\r\\nRandalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admit\\r\\nherself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed\\r\\nfor employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and,\\r\\npleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and\\r\\nfarther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or\\r\\nworking, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close\\r\\nof their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing\\r\\nelegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his\\r\\nside was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection was always to subside\\r\\ninto friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their\\r\\nparting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this,\\r\\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of\\r\\nher previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never\\r\\nto marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle\\r\\nthan she could foresee in her own feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\\r\\nthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\\r\\nreally necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\\r\\nnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I\\r\\nshould be sorry to be more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very\\r\\nmuch in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection\\r\\ncontinue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\\r\\ninexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I\\r\\nimagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he\\r\\nhad believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been\\r\\nso wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and\\r\\nlanguage at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must\\r\\nbe on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing\\r\\nwhat it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look\\r\\nupon him to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon\\r\\nhis steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imagine\\r\\nthem rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,\\r\\nmakes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I\\r\\nshall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a\\r\\ngood thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,\\r\\nand I shall have been let off easily.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\\r\\nshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her\\r\\nat first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\\r\\nundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\\r\\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\\r\\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,\\r\\nand describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\\r\\nattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\\r\\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\\r\\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\\r\\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\\r\\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more\\r\\nmight have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm\\r\\nof her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than\\r\\nonce, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\\r\\ncompliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in\\r\\nthe very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any\\r\\nsuch broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\\r\\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\\r\\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\\r\\nwords--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus\\r\\nto her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\\r\\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\\r\\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\\r\\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\\r\\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\\r\\n\\r\\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\\r\\npart, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\\r\\nto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could\\r\\nstill do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her.\\r\\nHer intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more\\r\\ninteresting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation\\r\\nand happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which\\r\\nclothed it, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeautiful little friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suggested to her the\\r\\nidea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was it\\r\\nimpossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\\r\\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness\\r\\nof her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\\r\\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For\\r\\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must not dwell upon it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must not think of it. I know\\r\\nthe danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\\r\\nhappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\\r\\nwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\\r\\nfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it\\r\\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter\\r\\nwas at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's\\r\\nengagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest\\r\\nhad entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's\\r\\ndisappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible\\r\\nform.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr.\\r\\nElton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter\\r\\nfrom Enscombe before \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton and his bride\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was in every body's\\r\\nmouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.\\r\\nShe had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's\\r\\nmind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.\\r\\nWith Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of\\r\\ninsensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had\\r\\nnot attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual\\r\\napproach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\r\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\\r\\ngive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had\\r\\na right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work\\r\\nto be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed\\r\\nto, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened\\r\\nsubmissively, and said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse\\r\\ndescribed--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not\\r\\nthink about them any longer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but no change of subject could avail, and\\r\\nthe next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as\\r\\nbefore. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\\r\\nElton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\\r\\nYou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.\\r\\nIt was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\\r\\nyou.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will\\r\\nbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\\r\\nforgetting it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\\r\\nexclamation. Emma continued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\\r\\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\\r\\nwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my\\r\\ncomfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your\\r\\nduty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of\\r\\nothers, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.\\r\\nThese are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very\\r\\nimportant--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act\\r\\nupon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.\\r\\nI want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes\\r\\nhave felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what\\r\\nwould be kind by me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\\r\\nwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\\r\\nloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\\r\\nof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to\\r\\nwhat was right and support her in it very tolerably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want\\r\\ngratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do\\r\\nfor you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\\r\\nmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\\r\\nwell, nor valued her affection so highly before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she afterwards to\\r\\nherself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness\\r\\nof heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the\\r\\nclearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It\\r\\nis tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\\r\\nbeloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--I have it not--but\\r\\nI know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the\\r\\ncharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not change\\r\\nyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\\r\\nbreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a\\r\\nhundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. I\\r\\nmention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\\r\\ninterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\\r\\nit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\\r\\nsettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\\r\\nnot pretty at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make\\r\\nher resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a\\r\\npoint of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might\\r\\nbe gone through as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\\r\\nwhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\\r\\nlace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\\r\\nwould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\\r\\nnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but\\r\\nshe behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit\\r\\nwas of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation\\r\\nof mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to\\r\\nform an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the\\r\\nnothing-meaning terms of being \\xe2\\x80\\x9celegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\\r\\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\\r\\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\\r\\nwas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\\r\\nbut neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\\r\\nthought at least it would turn out so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would not\\r\\npermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an\\r\\nawkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man\\r\\nhad need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\\r\\nwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\\r\\nprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\\r\\ndepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\\r\\nElton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\\r\\nmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\\r\\nbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\\r\\nlittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\\r\\ncould be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet, when they had quitted the\\r\\nhouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not she\\r\\nvery charming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and\\r\\nshe came in his way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Harriet, sighing again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say she was very\\r\\nmuch attached to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman\\r\\nwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this\\r\\nthe best offer she was likely to have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet earnestly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand well she might, nobody could ever\\r\\nhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\\r\\nsuperior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different\\r\\nthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and\\r\\nadmire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown\\r\\nhimself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman,\\r\\njust what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her 'Augusta.' How\\r\\ndelightful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\\r\\nmore and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,\\r\\nand her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\\r\\nof an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly\\r\\nattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that\\r\\nMrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\\r\\nthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very\\r\\nsuperior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert\\r\\nand familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people,\\r\\nand one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that\\r\\nher society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\\r\\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\\r\\nmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\\r\\nher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\\r\\nalliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy brother\\r\\nMr. Suckling's seat;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\\r\\ngrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\\r\\nmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed\\r\\nby the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\\r\\nimagine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the\\r\\nlikeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room\\r\\nat Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Mr. Elton was appealed\\r\\nto.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy\\r\\nherself at Maple Grove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\\r\\nstaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\\r\\ncould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\\r\\ndelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to\\r\\nas Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little\\r\\nsigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who\\r\\nsees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.\\r\\nWhenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\\r\\nunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\\r\\nwhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of\\r\\nmatrimony.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\\r\\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the\\r\\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\\r\\nThe laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\\r\\nvery much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse\\r\\nof a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\\r\\nmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\\r\\nwho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\\r\\nin the same style.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\\r\\npeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\\r\\nextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack\\r\\nan error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you\\r\\nhave overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\\r\\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\\r\\ncounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\\r\\nSurry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I fancy not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never heard any county but Surry called so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was silenced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer\\r\\nat farthest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Elton; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand that will be our time for\\r\\nexploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare\\r\\nsay. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four\\r\\nperfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,\\r\\nwe should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They\\r\\nwould hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the\\r\\nyear. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their\\r\\nbringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.\\r\\nWhen people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.\\r\\nSuckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston\\r\\ntwice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their\\r\\nfirst having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind\\r\\nhere, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\\r\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we\\r\\nare a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home\\r\\nthan engage in schemes of pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\\r\\nbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple\\r\\nGrove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,\\r\\n'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must\\r\\ngo in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau\\r\\nwithout a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,\\r\\nwould never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so;\\r\\nand yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,\\r\\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\\r\\nbad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\\r\\na proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I\\r\\nperfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking\\r\\ntowards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great\\r\\ndrawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend\\r\\nBath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse\\r\\ngood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\\r\\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\\r\\ndoes not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\\r\\nwaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\\r\\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\\r\\nthat it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,\\r\\nwhich, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\\r\\nrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\\r\\non them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\\r\\nunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\\r\\nso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\\r\\nsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\\r\\nacquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\\r\\nalways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\\r\\nattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\\r\\nwith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea\\r\\nof her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\\r\\n_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\\r\\nof Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the\\r\\nhelp of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have\\r\\ngiven, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut their going to Bath was\\r\\nquite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that\\r\\nthe place might suit her better than her father.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then, to prevent\\r\\nfarther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,\\r\\na lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known\\r\\nthat you are a superior performer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\\r\\nperformer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial\\r\\na quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\\r\\nmusic--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid\\r\\nof taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\\r\\n_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\\r\\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\\r\\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\\r\\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to\\r\\nme; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\\r\\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\\r\\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\\r\\nhome, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\\r\\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\\r\\nbeen accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\\r\\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\\r\\n_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\\r\\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\\r\\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had\\r\\nno resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite\\r\\nindependent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I\\r\\nreally could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any\\r\\nsacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every\\r\\nluxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not\\r\\nnecessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,\\r\\n'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a\\r\\nmusical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life\\r\\nwould be a blank to me.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot suppose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Mr. Elton would hesitate\\r\\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\\r\\nI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\\r\\npardoned, in consideration of the motive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\\r\\nfind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\\r\\nconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\\r\\nmusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\\r\\nWill not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\\r\\nnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\\r\\nparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\\r\\npractice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against\\r\\nthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,\\r\\nsurely?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\\r\\nI tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the\\r\\ninstrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.\\r\\nJeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.\\r\\nBird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my\\r\\nword it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with\\r\\nSelina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has\\r\\nmany things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this\\r\\nmorning shut up with my housekeeper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut every thing of that kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill soon be in so regular a\\r\\ntrain--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe shall see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\\r\\nmore to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have been calling at Randalls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand found them both at\\r\\nhome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\\r\\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite\\r\\nwith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good--there is\\r\\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\\r\\ndirectly. She was your governess, I think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\\r\\nwaited for the affirmative before she went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaving understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\\r\\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Weston's manners,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere always particularly good.\\r\\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\\r\\nmodel for any young woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who do you think came in while we were there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and\\r\\nhow could she possibly guess?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnightley!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Elton; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnightley himself!--Was not it\\r\\nlucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\\r\\nseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,\\r\\nI had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so often\\r\\nmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\\r\\ncaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.\\r\\nKnightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I\\r\\nthink, a very gentleman-like man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\\r\\nbreathe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInsufferable woman!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her immediate exclamation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorse than I had\\r\\nsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have\\r\\nbelieved it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call\\r\\nhim Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\\r\\nvulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\\r\\nresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\\r\\nActually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\\r\\nhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\\r\\nnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\\r\\nform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\\r\\nWeston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\\r\\ngentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\\r\\nmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\\r\\nChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\\r\\nwould be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly. Always the first\\r\\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\\r\\nas regularly into my mind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father\\r\\nhad arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was\\r\\nready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he deliberately began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsidering we never saw her\\r\\nbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\\r\\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\\r\\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe\\r\\nI am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\\r\\npoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\\r\\nyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\\r\\nhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\\r\\nhaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I\\r\\nsaid that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to\\r\\nhave gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews\\r\\nwhat a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage\\r\\nLane.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her\\r\\nif possible. It was being very deficient.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\\r\\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\\r\\nbe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\\r\\nmake so much of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\\r\\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,\\r\\nis never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\\r\\nknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\\r\\nthey may.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\\r\\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\\r\\nsuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere\\r\\ncommon politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\\r\\nencouragement to people to marry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\\r\\n_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long,\\r\\ndid they occupy her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\\r\\nopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\\r\\nMrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\\r\\nwhenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\\r\\nand ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,\\r\\nbut so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\\r\\nknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\\r\\nand conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\\r\\nElton's consequence only could surpass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from\\r\\nhis wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air\\r\\nof congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,\\r\\nas not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her\\r\\nnew acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,\\r\\nfollowing the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted\\r\\nthat the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed\\r\\nherself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise\\r\\npassed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with\\r\\na good grace of her being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery pleasant and very elegantly dressed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\\r\\nfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the\\r\\nlittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\\r\\nback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\\r\\nthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\\r\\nnecessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.\\r\\nElton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\\r\\nnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the\\r\\nsensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\\r\\nmuch.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been\\r\\nan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, under\\r\\na colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him,\\r\\nhad in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the object\\r\\nof their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be\\r\\nalways easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which\\r\\nthey dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in\\r\\ncontemptuous treatment of Harriet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\\r\\nmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\\r\\nrecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\\r\\nwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without\\r\\nsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\\r\\nbefriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\\r\\nthird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry\\r\\non the subject.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave\\r\\nabout Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\\r\\nladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very\\r\\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\\r\\nwell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\\r\\nis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,\\r\\nI talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her situation is so calculated\\r\\nto affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour\\r\\nto do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\\r\\nmust not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those\\r\\ncharming lines of the poet,\\r\\n\\r\\n        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\r\\n          'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot think there is any danger of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Emma's calm answer--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\nwhen you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and\\r\\nunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\\r\\nhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\\r\\nobscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\\r\\nwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\\r\\nI am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\\r\\nfeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I\\r\\nmust confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\\r\\ntimidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those\\r\\nwho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\\r\\nyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\\r\\nthan I can express.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of\\r\\nMiss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer\\r\\nthan yourself, can shew her any other attention than\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\\r\\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\\r\\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\\r\\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\\r\\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\\r\\nleast inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\\r\\nsend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\\r\\nthan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\\r\\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\\r\\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\\r\\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\\r\\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not\\r\\nat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my\\r\\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly have\\r\\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\\r\\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\\r\\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\\r\\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit\\r\\nher shortly.--I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\\r\\nbrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\\r\\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\\r\\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners\\r\\nof either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often\\r\\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\\r\\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Jane Fairfax!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--thought Emma.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have not deserved this. You\\r\\nmay have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\\r\\nbeyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.\\r\\nElton!--'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose\\r\\nthat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,\\r\\nthere seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\\r\\naddressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdear Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,\\r\\nand she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\\r\\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active\\r\\npatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\\r\\nway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for\\r\\nMrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\\r\\nsimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies--the\\r\\nmost amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and\\r\\ncondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize\\r\\nwas that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.\\r\\nElton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons,\\r\\nsitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was\\r\\nastonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or\\r\\nthe pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as\\r\\nthe Vicarage had to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a riddle, quite a riddle!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo chuse to remain here\\r\\nmonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\\r\\nmortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation,\\r\\nrather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her\\r\\nwith such real, generous affection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\\r\\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\\r\\npromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\\r\\ninvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\\r\\nBates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\\r\\nWould Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\\r\\ncontrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\\r\\ndeclined it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\\r\\nthis invitation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Emma's conclusion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must be under some sort\\r\\nof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great\\r\\nfear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She is _not_ to be\\r\\nwith the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she\\r\\nconsent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\\r\\nthe few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\\r\\napology for Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\\r\\nmy dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\\r\\ngood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\\r\\nmust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\\r\\nwhat she goes to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are right, Mrs. Weston,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley warmly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Fairfax\\r\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\r\\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\\r\\nher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from\\r\\nMrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\\r\\nwas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\\r\\nreplied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather\\r\\ndisgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should\\r\\nhave imagined any thing but inviting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not wonder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif Miss Fairfax were to have\\r\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in\\r\\naccepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may\\r\\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\r\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\\r\\nspite of the very natural wish of a little change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\\r\\nminutes silence, he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does\\r\\nnot talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\\r\\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\\r\\namongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\\r\\ncivility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more\\r\\nearly implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\\r\\nmay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\\r\\nAnd besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\\r\\nsure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\\r\\nand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\\r\\nrespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\\r\\nnever fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can\\r\\nprevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\\r\\nnot in consciousness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. Little Henry\\r\\nwas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\\r\\nirresolute what else to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany body may know how highly I think of her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\\r\\nstopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurried\\r\\non--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\\r\\nis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\\r\\nother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\r\\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\\r\\nsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\\r\\na hint of it six weeks ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\\r\\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\\r\\nsay, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shall\\r\\nnever ask her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased\\r\\nenough to exclaim,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner which\\r\\nshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\\r\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now,\\r\\nmeant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any\\r\\nidea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest\\r\\nwish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come\\r\\nin and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\\r\\nme by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And soon afterwards, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane Fairfax is a very charming young\\r\\nwoman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\\r\\nnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\\r\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\\r\\nwittier than his neighbours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\\r\\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--what\\r\\nshe calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\\r\\nin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she do for\\r\\nMr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts\\r\\nher civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\\r\\nweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\\r\\nof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\\r\\nMiss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's\\r\\nacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\\r\\nbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\\r\\nI cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\r\\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\\r\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her\\r\\na permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring\\r\\nparties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane Fairfax has feeling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not accuse her\\r\\nof want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her\\r\\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\\r\\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\\r\\nshe used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my\\r\\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\\r\\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no\\r\\nthought beyond.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Mrs. Weston,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma triumphantly when he left them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat do\\r\\nyou say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\\r\\nidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\\r\\nwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\\r\\ndisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\\r\\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\\r\\nin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\\r\\nnever to have a disengaged day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see how it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see what a life I am to lead among you.\\r\\nUpon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\\r\\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\\r\\nformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\\r\\ndisengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\\r\\nbeen at a loss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\\r\\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\\r\\ndinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\\r\\nthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\\r\\ncard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\\r\\ngood deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew\\r\\nthem how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring\\r\\nshe must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which\\r\\nher card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\\r\\nunbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the\\r\\nevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\\r\\nrefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\\r\\nHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\\r\\nshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\\r\\nresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\\r\\nten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\\r\\nusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\\r\\nwith the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the\\r\\nEltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\\r\\ncourse--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\\r\\nbe asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with\\r\\nequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\\r\\nby Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe would rather not\\r\\nbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite\\r\\nable to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\\r\\nuncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\\r\\nrather stay at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\\r\\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\\r\\nfortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to\\r\\ngive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\\r\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\\r\\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she\\r\\nwas more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\\r\\nbeen.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\\r\\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is very true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat least as far as relates to me, which\\r\\nwas all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and\\r\\nalways knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She will\\r\\nnever like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her\\r\\ngreater attention than I have done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\\r\\nhappy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\\r\\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\\r\\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\\r\\nweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\\r\\nstaying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day\\r\\nof this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being\\r\\nput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\\r\\nso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\\r\\nutmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma\\r\\napprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\\r\\nbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\\r\\nfalling in with a dinner-party.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\\r\\nrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet\\r\\nhe always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\\r\\nimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\\r\\nhave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\\r\\ninstead of his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\\r\\nKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\\r\\nmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\\r\\nevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\\r\\nand the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\\r\\nphilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\\r\\nchief of even Emma's vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\\r\\nKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\\r\\nagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\\r\\nwaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,\\r\\nas elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\\r\\nsilence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but\\r\\nMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk\\r\\nto her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk\\r\\nwith his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was\\r\\nnatural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\\r\\nsure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\\r\\nturned directly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went only to the post-office,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand reached home before the\\r\\nrain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when\\r\\nI am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk\\r\\nbefore breakfast does me good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards\\r\\nfrom your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry\\r\\nand John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The\\r\\npost-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have\\r\\nlived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going\\r\\nthrough the rain for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\\r\\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\\r\\nolder should make me indifferent about letters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\\r\\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\\r\\npositive curse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\\r\\nfriendship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have often thought them the worst of the two,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he coolly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBusiness, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am\\r\\nvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\\r\\ncan easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\\r\\nto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which\\r\\nmakes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every\\r\\nbody dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;\\r\\nand therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,\\r\\nI think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\\r\\nto-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said John Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI meant to imply the change of situation which\\r\\ntime usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will\\r\\ngenerally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily\\r\\ncircle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old\\r\\nfriend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence\\r\\nyou may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthank\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\\r\\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\\r\\nnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such\\r\\noccasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular\\r\\ncompliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildest\\r\\nurbanity, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\\r\\nin the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies\\r\\nare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\\r\\ncomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\\r\\nsolicitude about me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I\\r\\nhope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\\r\\nold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\\r\\ndo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I\\r\\nare both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\\r\\nsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\\r\\nhad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\\r\\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the\\r\\nrain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do\\r\\nsuch a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\\r\\nhow to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\\r\\ndid you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\\r\\nauthority.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy advice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly do\\r\\nfeel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable\\r\\nas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\\r\\ncareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\\r\\nrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\\r\\nhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough\\r\\nagain. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too\\r\\nreasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d eagerly rejoined Mrs.\\r\\nElton. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will not allow her to do such a thing again:\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and nodding\\r\\nsignificantly--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\\r\\nI shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\\r\\n(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\\r\\nbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from\\r\\n_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept\\r\\nsuch an accommodation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are extremely kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I cannot give up my early\\r\\nwalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\\r\\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\\r\\nscarcely ever had a bad morning before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\\r\\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\\r\\nwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\\r\\nyou and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\\r\\nmyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\\r\\nmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\\r\\nsettled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane earnestly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot by any means consent to such\\r\\nan arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand\\r\\nwere not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am\\r\\nnot here, by my grandmama's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to\\r\\nemploy our men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\\r\\nanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe post-office is a wonderful establishment!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\\r\\nand all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is certainly very well regulated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that\\r\\na letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\\r\\nkingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,\\r\\nactually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\\r\\nhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness\\r\\nof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\\r\\nexplanation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued he, smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are paid for it. That is\\r\\nthe key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\\r\\nwell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\\r\\nobservations made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard it asserted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the same sort\\r\\nof handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\\r\\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\\r\\nthe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very\\r\\nlittle teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can\\r\\nget. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not\\r\\nalways known their writing apart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his brother hesitatingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is a likeness. I know what\\r\\nyou mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsabella and Emma both write beautifully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\nalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--with half a sigh and half a\\r\\nsmile at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never saw any gentleman's handwriting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Emma began, looking also at\\r\\nMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\\r\\nto some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, how am\\r\\nI going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\\r\\nbefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\\r\\nphrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that\\r\\nwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce\\r\\nhis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\\r\\nbetter.--Now for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Frank Churchill\\r\\nwrites one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not admire it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is too small--wants\\r\\nstrength. It is like a woman's writing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\\r\\nthe base aspersion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a\\r\\nlarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any\\r\\nletter about her to produce?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No, she had heard from him very lately,\\r\\nbut having answered the letter, had put it away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we were in the other room,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I had my writing-desk, I\\r\\nam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.--Do not you\\r\\nremember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe chose to say he was employed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\\r\\nMr. Knightley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley dryly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwrites to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of\\r\\ncourse, put forth his best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\\r\\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\\r\\nallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMust I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\\r\\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\\r\\nthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\\r\\n_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full\\r\\nexpectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been\\r\\nin vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a\\r\\nglow both of complexion and spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\\r\\nexpense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--but she\\r\\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt\\r\\nJane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the\\r\\nroom, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the\\r\\nbeauty and grace of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it\\r\\nhardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with so\\r\\nmuch perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\\r\\nJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to\\r\\nbe almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\\r\\nleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she\\r\\nsoon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a\\r\\nhalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding\\r\\na knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching\\r\\ncold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion;\\r\\nand to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant\\r\\nto Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\\r\\nsuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is April come!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI get quite anxious about you. June\\r\\nwill soon be here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked\\r\\nforward to the summer in general.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut have you really heard of nothing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\\r\\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI not aware!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, shaking her head; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdear Mrs. Elton, who can\\r\\nhave thought of it as I have done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\\r\\nhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\\r\\na vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\\r\\nMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\\r\\nbody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle.\\r\\nWax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all\\r\\nhouses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see\\r\\nyou in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cColonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Jane. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\\r\\nit;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\\r\\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\\r\\ntrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\\r\\nmore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\\r\\na day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\\r\\nfor any thing eligible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to\\r\\nher; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\\r\\ntrouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\\r\\nor say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\\r\\nus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve,\\r\\nand your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence,\\r\\nis not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin\\r\\ninquiring directly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\\r\\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When\\r\\nI am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being\\r\\nlong unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\\r\\nwould soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human\\r\\nflesh--but of human intellect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\\r\\nthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to\\r\\nthe abolition.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoverness-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\\r\\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\\r\\nthe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But\\r\\nI only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\\r\\napplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\\r\\nsomething that would do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething that would do!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Mrs. Elton. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, _that_ may suit\\r\\nyour humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are;\\r\\nbut it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\\r\\nthing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\\r\\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\\r\\nlife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\\r\\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\\r\\nthink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\\r\\nA gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\\r\\nbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\\r\\non my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\\r\\nfirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\\r\\nyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\\r\\nas much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you\\r\\nmight do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I\\r\\nreally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what\\r\\nyou chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\\r\\ncomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such\\r\\na situation together,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are pretty sure to be equal;\\r\\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted\\r\\nat present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\\r\\nobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\\r\\nnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\\r\\nshall remain where I am, and as I am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I am quite serious too, I assure you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cin resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\\r\\nwatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object,\\r\\nand Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\\r\\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\\r\\nhe is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\\r\\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\\r\\nmodern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\\r\\nyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\\r\\nbegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I\\r\\nam rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\\r\\nit?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it\\r\\nis not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\\r\\nover-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\\r\\nnow, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\\r\\na bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style\\r\\nof dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\\r\\nminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show\\r\\nand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\\r\\ntrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\\r\\nlook well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\\r\\nWeston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner,\\r\\nand walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too much\\r\\nexpected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy. Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry\\r\\nto see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That\\r\\na man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day\\r\\nof business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile\\r\\nto another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till\\r\\nbed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise\\r\\nof numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been\\r\\nin motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been\\r\\nstill, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had\\r\\nbeen in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to\\r\\nquit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the\\r\\nevening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could\\r\\nhe by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there\\r\\nwould have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather\\r\\nthan break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement,\\r\\nthen shrugged his shoulders, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could not have believed it\\r\\neven of _him_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\\r\\nexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\\r\\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\\r\\nmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\\r\\ninquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\\r\\nher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\\r\\nabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\\r\\ncommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\\r\\nhad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\\r\\nthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\\r\\nhad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRead it, read it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit will give you pleasure; only a few\\r\\nlines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\\r\\nto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to\\r\\nevery body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\\r\\nto it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne,\\r\\nmy dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--In\\r\\ntown next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\\r\\nimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\\r\\nlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\\r\\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\\r\\nagain, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\\r\\nand he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\\r\\nWell, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\\r\\nit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\\r\\nother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\\r\\ncircumstance to the others in a common way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks\\r\\nand words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\\r\\nhappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and\\r\\nopen; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupied\\r\\nin weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her\\r\\nagitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\\r\\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\\r\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\r\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he might\\r\\nnot have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\\r\\ndelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\\r\\nbe made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\\r\\nshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\\r\\nbeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\\r\\nElton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject\\r\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mr. Weston.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her\\r\\nby such a hope, smiled most graciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\\r\\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\\r\\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\\r\\nHe is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\\r\\nletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\\r\\nson's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it\\r\\nwas to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\\r\\nhardly ever get a letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\\r\\nWeston--(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most\\r\\ndangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours\\r\\nfollow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\\r\\nmarried women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\\r\\nnot have believed it of you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\\r\\nElton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,\\r\\nmerely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up to\\r\\ntown directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has not been well the\\r\\nwhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--so they are all to\\r\\nmove southward without loss of time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\\r\\nconsiderable journey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\\r\\nfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\\r\\nof large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\\r\\nSuckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me--but twice\\r\\nin one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\\r\\nhorses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe evil of the distance from Enscombe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis, that\\r\\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\\r\\nsofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she complained, he\\r\\nsaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\r\\nboth his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\\r\\nweakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\\r\\nsleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. Certainly,\\r\\ndelicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\\r\\nmust grant me that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\\r\\nown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidable\\r\\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women--and I assure you,\\r\\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\\r\\nwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to\\r\\navoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her--and I believe I have\\r\\ncaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\\r\\nan excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDepend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\\r\\nlady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land\\r\\nfor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\\r\\nyou. Do not run away with such an idea.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\\r\\na fine lady as any body ever beheld.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\\r\\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\\r\\n_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\\r\\nit;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\\r\\nWeston went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but\\r\\nthis is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\\r\\ntherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\\r\\nnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would\\r\\nnot say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill's illness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to\\r\\nClifton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\\r\\nher. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\\r\\nbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\\r\\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\\r\\nretired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\\r\\nthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\\r\\nseem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--And\\r\\nMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\\r\\nthat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in\\r\\nherself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot\\r\\nhave too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many\\r\\nmyself as to be quite independent of society.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrank was here in February for a fortnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\\r\\nof Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\\r\\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\\r\\nsuch a creature in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\\r\\nWeston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.\\r\\nNot heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full\\r\\nof very little else than Mrs. Elton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen Frank left us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was quite uncertain when we\\r\\nmight see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has\\r\\nbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\\r\\nhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\\r\\nup--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\\r\\ndesponding. 'How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed\\r\\nthat his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and so forth--I always\\r\\nfelt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.\\r\\nI have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things\\r\\nare going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to\\r\\na certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because\\r\\nthings did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity\\r\\nwhich suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that\\r\\nhe was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robe\\r\\nwould be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those\\r\\ngloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had\\r\\ndisappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came to\\r\\nme quite in despair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\\r\\nseized the opportunity of going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\\r\\nis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\\r\\nEnscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\\r\\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the\\r\\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\\r\\nthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\\r\\nnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\\r\\nof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;\\r\\nthere always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\\r\\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\\r\\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\\r\\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\\r\\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\\r\\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\\r\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\\r\\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\\r\\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's\\r\\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\\r\\ngratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\\r\\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\\r\\nFrank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\\r\\nof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly\\r\\nguided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall\\r\\njudge of him.--I am no flatterer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston was musing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he presently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\\r\\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to\\r\\nspeak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,\\r\\nMrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have\\r\\nmet with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid\\r\\nto her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been\\r\\nslighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride\\r\\nis nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort\\r\\nof pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless\\r\\nand tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what\\r\\ninclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.\\r\\nShe was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman;\\r\\nbut ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd\\r\\nthem all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is\\r\\nan upstart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite\\r\\na horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\\r\\npeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\\r\\nare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\\r\\nthemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\\r\\ndirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\\r\\nencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,\\r\\nand expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.\\r\\nA year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West\\r\\nHall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from\\r\\nBirmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.\\r\\nOne has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something\\r\\ndireful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the\\r\\nTupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\\r\\nyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to\\r\\nmy brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\\r\\nneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\\r\\nyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--I\\r\\nbelieve, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\\r\\nthe purchase before his death.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\\r\\nsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\\r\\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\\r\\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\\r\\nnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits\\r\\nwhich would have made her prefer being silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\\r\\nleave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\\r\\nboys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full\\r\\nlength there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than\\r\\nher's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to\\r\\nrecommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\\r\\nthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rather hope to satisfy you both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I shall do all\\r\\nin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\\r\\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is very likely. You think so, do not you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even\\r\\nmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to\\r\\nincrease as much as they have done lately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIncrease!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\\r\\ngreat difference in your way of life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDifference! No indeed I am not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than\\r\\nyou used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only\\r\\none day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happen\\r\\nbefore, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you\\r\\nmix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought\\r\\nan account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the\\r\\nCrown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your\\r\\ngoings-on, is very great.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his brother quickly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is Randalls that does it all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\\r\\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that\\r\\nHenry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg\\r\\nyou to send them home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat need not be the consequence. Let them\\r\\nbe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou amuse me! I should like to know how\\r\\nmany of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of\\r\\nthe party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to\\r\\nattend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine--what have\\r\\nthey been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of,\\r\\nwhich never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John\\r\\nKnightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\\r\\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to\\r\\nMr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from\\r\\nHartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I\\r\\ncannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt\\r\\nEmma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better\\r\\nwith Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she\\r\\nis absent one--and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself\\r\\nor settling his accounts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\\r\\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVOLUME III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\\r\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\\r\\nwas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\\r\\napprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\\r\\nreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but\\r\\nif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\\r\\ntwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had\\r\\ntaken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\\r\\nmonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\\r\\nher:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did\\r\\nnot mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\\r\\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\\r\\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\\r\\nacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\\r\\ndecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\\r\\ncrisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil\\r\\nstate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\\r\\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's\\r\\nfeelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been\\r\\nimagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down\\r\\nfor a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from\\r\\nRandalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick\\r\\nobservation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she\\r\\nmust act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt\\r\\nof his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt\\r\\nof his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness\\r\\nin the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he was\\r\\nless in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably\\r\\nof her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\\r\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he\\r\\nwas not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\\r\\nhis comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently\\r\\nfluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed\\r\\na liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief\\r\\non the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying\\r\\naway to make other calls in Highbury. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had seen a group of old\\r\\nacquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not stopped, he would\\r\\nnot stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity to think they would\\r\\nbe disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer\\r\\nat Hartfield, he must hurry off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She had no doubt as to his being less\\r\\nin love--but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed\\r\\nlike a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a\\r\\ndread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting\\r\\nhimself with her long.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\\r\\nHe was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. His\\r\\naunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\\r\\nRandall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\\r\\nto be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no\\r\\nservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\\r\\nreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at\\r\\nRandalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked\\r\\nback, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a\\r\\nyear ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care\\r\\nand medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many\\r\\nyears of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all\\r\\nhis father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary,\\r\\nor that she was as strong as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could\\r\\nnot endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\\r\\nsuffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randalls\\r\\ncommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\\r\\nRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\\r\\nan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\\r\\nready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\\r\\nexpected from the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\\r\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\\r\\nbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the\\r\\nhouse was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\\r\\nthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\\r\\ncould even wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\\r\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\\r\\nhoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.\\r\\nIt was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\\r\\nreally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to\\r\\na young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The\\r\\ndifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\\r\\nthe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\\r\\nmiles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was\\r\\na serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be\\r\\nspent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in\\r\\nLondon; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very\\r\\ndistance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\\r\\nremoval,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,\\r\\nbut it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\\r\\nhowever, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\\r\\nvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from\\r\\nFrank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and\\r\\nthat he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at\\r\\nany given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\\r\\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\\r\\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\\r\\nspend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\\r\\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any\\r\\nthing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\\r\\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\\r\\nChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before\\r\\ndinner, and every thing was safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room\\r\\nat the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a\\r\\ncommon meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\\r\\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\\r\\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of\\r\\nthe rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,\\r\\nand must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.\\r\\nShe was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the\\r\\nRandalls party just sufficiently before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\\r\\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\\r\\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should\\r\\nbe; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another\\r\\ncarriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great\\r\\nsurprize. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo unreasonably early!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she was going to exclaim; but she\\r\\npresently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,\\r\\nlike herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and\\r\\nthey were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,\\r\\nwho had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing\\r\\nearnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company\\r\\nmight soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory\\r\\ninspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston\\r\\ndepended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man\\r\\nwho had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\\r\\ndistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but\\r\\na little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\\r\\ncharacter.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a\\r\\nman what he ought to be.--She could fancy such a man. The whole party\\r\\nwalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing\\r\\nelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe\\r\\nin their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though\\r\\n_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy\\r\\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door\\r\\nto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\\r\\nbrought by the Eltons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\\r\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\\r\\nthe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient\\r\\nto begin, or afraid of being always near her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton was spoken of. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think she must be here soon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\\r\\nIt cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\\r\\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\\r\\npassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weston, looking about. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nthought you were to bring them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\\r\\nlonged to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\\r\\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\\r\\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\\r\\nby giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank to his father:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bates must not be forgotten:\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and away he went. Mr. Weston was\\r\\nfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\\r\\nof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\\r\\nthough by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\\r\\nI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\\r\\npleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him\\r\\na very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\\r\\napprove--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\\r\\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.\\r\\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor\\r\\nme had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\\r\\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\\r\\nmuch better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but\\r\\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\\r\\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt of its being our\\r\\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\\r\\nextremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What\\r\\na pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand you\\r\\nwere so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.\\r\\nYou may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\\r\\nthe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\\r\\nWeston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood\\r\\nby any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,\\r\\nwere soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in\\r\\ntalking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her\\r\\nbeing admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was\\r\\nheard,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\\r\\ncare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as soon\\r\\nas she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is\\r\\nadmirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\\r\\nnot have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you\\r\\never see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's\\r\\nlamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\\r\\nI came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said\\r\\nI--but I had not time for more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery\\r\\nwell, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\\r\\nit. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,\\r\\nand knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.\\r\\nAh! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent\\r\\ntime. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most\\r\\ncomfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,\\r\\nMrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,\\r\\nor we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were\\r\\nsuch neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank\\r\\nyou, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her\\r\\ntake her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\\r\\nMrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\\r\\nBought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three\\r\\nothers, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel\\r\\nCampbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did\\r\\nnot wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step\\r\\nupon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank\\r\\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in\\r\\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\\r\\nyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\\r\\nChurchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do\\r\\nyou do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite\\r\\nin fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know\\r\\n(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are\\r\\na judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\\r\\nhair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I\\r\\ndeclare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\\r\\nmoment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This\\r\\nis delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is.\\r\\nDon't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How\\r\\ndo you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through\\r\\nthe town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway\\r\\nand Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.\\r\\nArthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much\\r\\nobliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can\\r\\nthis be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming\\r\\nto be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am\\r\\nquite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A\\r\\nlittle tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\\r\\nEvery thing so good!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\\r\\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse\\r\\nof Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind\\r\\nher.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not\\r\\ndetermine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,\\r\\ncompliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently\\r\\nwanting to be complimented herself--and it was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you like\\r\\nmy gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my\\r\\nhair?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\\r\\npoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody can think less of dress in\\r\\ngeneral than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's\\r\\neyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have\\r\\nno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish\\r\\nto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\\r\\nmine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall\\r\\nsee if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\\r\\nI like him very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\\r\\nbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\\r\\nmore;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\\r\\nanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly\\r\\nforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was\\r\\nthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\\r\\ntidings of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\\r\\ndispleasure.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\\r\\nsuppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you like Mrs. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are ungrateful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUngrateful!--What do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then changing from a frown to a\\r\\nsmile--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where\\r\\nis my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\\r\\noff to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\\r\\nlaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\\r\\nmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\\r\\ninterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma\\r\\nheard the sad truth with fortitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weston.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe will think Frank ought to ask her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\\r\\nboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect\\r\\napprobation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_\\r\\nto dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to\\r\\npersuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.\\r\\nElton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.\\r\\nEmma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always\\r\\nconsidered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make\\r\\nher think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this\\r\\ntime, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to\\r\\nbegin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston\\r\\nmight be his son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,\\r\\nEmma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length\\r\\nof the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours\\r\\nof unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among\\r\\nthe standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not\\r\\nclassing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who\\r\\nwere pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were\\r\\nmade up,--so young as he looked!--He could not have appeared to greater\\r\\nadvantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,\\r\\nfirm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of\\r\\nthe elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;\\r\\nand, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of\\r\\nyoung men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\\r\\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,\\r\\nwith what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the\\r\\ntrouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but\\r\\nin general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom\\r\\nbetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He seemed often\\r\\nobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her\\r\\ndancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel\\r\\nafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\\r\\nThey seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank\\r\\nChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\\r\\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\\r\\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\\r\\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\\r\\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\\r\\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually\\r\\nare. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two\\r\\nlast dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the\\r\\nonly young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the\\r\\nnumber of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the\\r\\nwonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton\\r\\nsauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible\\r\\nto be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him\\r\\nevery moment to escape into the card-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nEscape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where\\r\\nthe sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front\\r\\nof them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining\\r\\nit. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or\\r\\nspeaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw it. She was not yet\\r\\ndancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore\\r\\nleisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw\\r\\nit all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly\\r\\nbehind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.\\r\\nElton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which\\r\\njust then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that\\r\\nhis wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only\\r\\nlistening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The\\r\\nkind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not you dance, Mr. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to which his prompt reply was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost\\r\\nreadily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\\r\\ndancer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall have great\\r\\npleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\\r\\nmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\\r\\ngreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\\r\\nGilbert.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\\r\\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss\\r\\nSmith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I\\r\\nwere not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.\\r\\nYou will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\\r\\ncommand--but my dancing days are over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\\r\\nmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the\\r\\namiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She looked round for a moment; he\\r\\nhad joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself\\r\\nfor settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him\\r\\nand his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\\r\\nface might be as hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading\\r\\nHarriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\\r\\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\\r\\nboth for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\\r\\ntoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\\r\\ncatch his eye again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\\r\\nand Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\\r\\nthe cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\\r\\nand very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\\r\\nannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\\r\\nflew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\\r\\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\\r\\ngrowing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\\r\\naudibly to her partner,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,\\r\\nI declare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from\\r\\nthat moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and\\r\\ntaking up her spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.\\r\\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will\\r\\nbe draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door\\r\\nnailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.\\r\\nMr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so\\r\\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\\r\\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and\\r\\nnobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\\r\\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\\r\\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\\r\\nand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some\\r\\nof her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\\r\\namused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall\\r\\nJane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell\\r\\nyou all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\\r\\nI do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear\\r\\nsir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am\\r\\nnot helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and\\r\\nme on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is\\r\\ngoing; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we\\r\\nall follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we\\r\\nare at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,\\r\\nthere is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!\\r\\nI was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any\\r\\nthing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\\r\\nyou of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The\\r\\nbaked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there\\r\\nwas a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at\\r\\nfirst, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled\\r\\nenough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves\\r\\nbetter than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,\\r\\nbut we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of\\r\\nits getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much\\r\\nconcerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have\\r\\nsupposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing\\r\\nlike it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,\\r\\nso that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\\r\\nOh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only\\r\\nit seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house\\r\\ncannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes\\r\\nfor grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but\\r\\nit smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\\r\\nbut, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited\\r\\nhim irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\\r\\nreprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\\r\\nand Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma, why is it\\r\\nthat they are your enemies?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\\r\\nbe.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\\r\\nthat you did want him to marry Harriet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand they cannot forgive me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\\r\\nonly said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell\\r\\nme I am wrong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong,\\r\\nI am sure the other tells you of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is\\r\\na littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I\\r\\nwas fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a\\r\\nseries of strange blunders!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\\r\\njustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\\r\\nchosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\\r\\nMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\\r\\ngirl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\\r\\nwoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of\\r\\nMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\\r\\ndoing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\\r\\nEvery body is asleep!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am ready,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhenever I am wanted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhom are you going to dance with?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Knightley.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith you, if you will ask\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, offering his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\\r\\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrother and sister! no, indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\\r\\npleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\\r\\nshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely\\r\\nglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\\r\\nEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\\r\\nalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\\r\\npeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\\r\\nminutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\\r\\noccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\\r\\nto another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--From\\r\\nHarriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the\\r\\nballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly\\r\\nopened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior\\r\\ncreature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could\\r\\nharbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious\\r\\ncourtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\\r\\nsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\\r\\nrequisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\\r\\nMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\\r\\nmust be before her!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he\\r\\ncould not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was\\r\\nto be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\\r\\nto rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\\r\\nfor the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\\r\\nwhen the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she\\r\\nhad never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet\\r\\nleaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince\\r\\nher that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white\\r\\nand frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--The iron gates and the\\r\\nfront-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in\\r\\nthe hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\\r\\nand surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\\r\\nsuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\\r\\nwith the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\\r\\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\\r\\nfor safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,\\r\\nmaking a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\\r\\nfor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies\\r\\nhad advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\\r\\ndistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\\r\\nparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\\r\\nMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling\\r\\non Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at\\r\\nthe top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\\r\\nBut poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp\\r\\nafter dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such\\r\\na return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, and\\r\\nexceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\\r\\ncourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\\r\\nnot be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,\\r\\nheaded by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent\\r\\nin look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she\\r\\nimmediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a\\r\\nshilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--She\\r\\nwas then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her\\r\\nterror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather\\r\\nsurrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\\r\\nconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\\r\\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\\r\\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\\r\\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\\r\\na mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair\\r\\nof scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\\r\\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\\r\\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being\\r\\non foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\\r\\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\\r\\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\\r\\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\\r\\nenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome.\\r\\nIt was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of\\r\\nHarriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--He dared\\r\\nnot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him\\r\\nnot another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\\r\\nsafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\\r\\nin the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful\\r\\nblessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman\\r\\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\\r\\nideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\\r\\nleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\\r\\nhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\\r\\nheard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\\r\\nat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much\\r\\nmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\\r\\nforesight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\\r\\nmind had already made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\\r\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\\r\\nrencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very\\r\\nperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\\r\\nto pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And\\r\\nknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\\r\\nperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\\r\\nattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.\\r\\nIt seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting\\r\\nconsequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be\\r\\nstrongly recommending each to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, while\\r\\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\\r\\nher naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\\r\\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's\\r\\nown account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\\r\\nabominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was\\r\\nto take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\\r\\nShe would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\\r\\ninterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.\\r\\nIt was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\\r\\nshe soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\\r\\nit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\\r\\nwho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\\r\\nthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's\\r\\nball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat,\\r\\nand, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their\\r\\npromising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort\\r\\nto him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his\\r\\nneighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss\\r\\nSmith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\\r\\nthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\\r\\nindifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\\r\\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\\r\\nan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man,\\r\\nfor she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\\r\\nillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\\r\\nthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\\r\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\\r\\ndwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\\r\\nnephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\\r\\nJohn were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\\r\\ngipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\\r\\nslightest particular from the original recital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\\r\\nmorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\\r\\nand hesitating, thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should\\r\\nlike to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it\\r\\nwill be over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\\r\\nseriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as her\\r\\nwords, for something more than ordinary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto have\\r\\nno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\\r\\ncreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have\\r\\nthe satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\\r\\nnecessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\\r\\nI dare say you understand me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow I could so long a time be fancying myself!...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet,\\r\\nwarmly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\\r\\nin him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not--except that of the\\r\\ntwo I had rather not see him--and indeed I would go any distance round\\r\\nto avoid him--but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\\r\\nher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\\r\\nall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall\\r\\nnever forget her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\\r\\nit will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I\\r\\nhave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to\\r\\nhave destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--I know that\\r\\nvery well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I will destroy it\\r\\nall--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\\r\\nmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\\r\\nholds?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, with a conscious look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\\r\\nvery much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\\r\\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\\r\\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\\r\\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\\r\\nwhich Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\\r\\nexcepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou _must_ recollect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed I do not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\\r\\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\\r\\ntimes we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my\\r\\nsore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the\\r\\nvery evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\\r\\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none\\r\\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\\r\\nmine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\\r\\ncut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he\\r\\ngave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making\\r\\na treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now\\r\\nand then as a great treat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Harriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\\r\\nand jumping up, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\\r\\nRemember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\\r\\nrelic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the\\r\\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\\r\\nabout me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my\\r\\npocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual\\r\\nblush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what\\r\\nelse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\\r\\nit, you did it so naturally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\r\\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLord\\r\\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\\r\\npiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\\r\\nnever was equal to this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chere is something\\r\\nstill more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\\r\\nthis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\\r\\nnever did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an\\r\\nold pencil,--the part without any lead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was really his,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harriet.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not you remember one\\r\\nmorning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactly\\r\\nthe day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\\r\\n_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\\r\\nabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\\r\\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\\r\\nhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\\r\\nit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\\r\\ntable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\\r\\ndared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do remember it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI perfectly remember it.--Talking\\r\\nabout spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\\r\\nliked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I\\r\\nperfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was\\r\\nnot he? I have an idea he was standing just here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot\\r\\nrecollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\\r\\nam now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, go on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that\\r\\nI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see\\r\\nme do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\\r\\ntreasuring up these things?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\\r\\ncould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\\r\\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--but\\r\\nhad not resolution enough to part with them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not\\r\\na word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\\r\\nuseful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be happier to burn it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Harriet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has a disagreeable\\r\\nlook to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there is\\r\\nan end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd when,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already\\r\\nmade, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ no\\r\\nfortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight\\r\\nafter the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite\\r\\nundesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the\\r\\ninformation she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course\\r\\nof some trivial chat, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise\\r\\nyou to do so and so\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's\\r\\nsilence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall never\\r\\nmarry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\\r\\nmoment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever marry!--This is a new resolution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is one that I shall never change, however.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter another short hesitation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope it does not proceed from--I hope\\r\\nit is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Elton indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet indignantly.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and Emma could\\r\\njust catch the words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso superior to Mr. Elton!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\\r\\nfarther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps\\r\\nHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were\\r\\ntotally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too\\r\\nmuch; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such\\r\\nan open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly\\r\\nresolved.--She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at\\r\\nonce, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always\\r\\nbest. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any\\r\\napplication of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the\\r\\njudicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided,\\r\\nand thus spoke--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\\r\\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\\r\\nan idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your\\r\\nsuperior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\\r\\nIndeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\\r\\ndistance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\\r\\nthe world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\\r\\nproper, in me especially.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\\r\\nwas enough to warm your heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cService! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The very\\r\\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw him\\r\\ncoming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In\\r\\none moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes,\\r\\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that\\r\\nit will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\\r\\nadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage\\r\\nfor its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\\r\\nwisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\\r\\nlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\\r\\nobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\\r\\ngive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\\r\\nthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\\r\\nknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very\\r\\nwrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt,\\r\\nand there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but\\r\\nyet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been\\r\\nmatches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not\\r\\nhave you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your\\r\\nraising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall\\r\\nalways know how to value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\\r\\nvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend.\\r\\nIts tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--and it must be\\r\\nsaving her from the danger of degradation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\\r\\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\\r\\nEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\\r\\nto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\\r\\ngrandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again\\r\\ndelayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely\\r\\nto remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able\\r\\nto defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from\\r\\nbeing hurried into a delightful situation against her will.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\\r\\ntaken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\\r\\nhim more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit\\r\\nof Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing\\r\\ndeclared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's\\r\\nguarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and\\r\\nindiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him\\r\\nto Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley\\r\\nbegan to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He\\r\\ncould not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between\\r\\nthem--he thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his side, which,\\r\\nhaving once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely\\r\\nvoid of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors\\r\\nof imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.\\r\\nHe was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he\\r\\nhad seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from\\r\\nthe admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was\\r\\nagain in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen;\\r\\nnor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and\\r\\nhis fire at twilight,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMyself creating what I saw,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private\\r\\nliking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\\r\\nhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined\\r\\nthem; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like\\r\\nthemselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\\r\\nweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\\r\\nand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\\r\\nreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\\r\\nvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\\r\\nand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and\\r\\nafter a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened\\r\\nto, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most\\r\\nobliging invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.\\r\\nThe gentlemen spoke of his horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the bye,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\nbecame of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not know that he ever had\\r\\nany such plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe! impossible!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what\\r\\nwas certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\\r\\nextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\\r\\nthought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\\r\\nmust remember it now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must have\\r\\ndreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if\\r\\nyou were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is this?--What is this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabout Perry and a\\r\\ncarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can\\r\\nafford it. You had it from himself, had you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied his son, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI seem to have had it from\\r\\nnobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having\\r\\nmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all\\r\\nthese particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\\r\\nit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.\\r\\nI dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone\\r\\nthrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nPerry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is odd though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed his father, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you should have had such\\r\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\r\\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage! and\\r\\nhis wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--just\\r\\nwhat will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\\r\\npremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\\r\\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream\\r\\ncertainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.\\r\\nEmma, you are a great dreamer, I think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\\r\\nprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr.\\r\\nWeston's hint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, to own the truth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\\r\\nto be heard the last two minutes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I must speak on this subject,\\r\\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean\\r\\nto say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\\r\\ndreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\\r\\nthat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\\r\\nmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\\r\\nourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\\r\\nthought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\\r\\nhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\\r\\nbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember\\r\\ngrandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we\\r\\nhad been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\\r\\nRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed\\r\\nI do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\\r\\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\\r\\nbeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\\r\\nI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\\r\\nnever dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before\\r\\nI am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and\\r\\nthen I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like\\r\\nJane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least\\r\\nthing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember\\r\\nMrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss\\r\\nBates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where\\r\\nhe thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\\r\\ninvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\\r\\nwith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited\\r\\nat the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\\r\\nChurchill the determination of catching her eye--he seemed watching her\\r\\nintently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between them\\r\\ninto the hall, and looked at neither.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\\r\\nborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the\\r\\nlarge modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and\\r\\nwhich none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her\\r\\nfather to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his\\r\\ndaily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,\\r\\nand nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\\r\\nhim, which he could reach as he sat, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave your nephews taken away their\\r\\nalphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?\\r\\nThis is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather\\r\\nas winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one\\r\\nmorning. I want to puzzle you again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\\r\\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\\r\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\\r\\nfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness\\r\\nof the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had\\r\\noften been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had\\r\\noccasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,\\r\\nwith tender melancholy, over the departure of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoor little boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how\\r\\nbeautifully Emma had written it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\\r\\nglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\\r\\nEmma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\\r\\nall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\\r\\napparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\\r\\npushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\\r\\nburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\\r\\nlooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\\r\\nevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to\\r\\nwork. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The\\r\\nword was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a\\r\\nblush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.\\r\\nMr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,\\r\\nwas beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his\\r\\nfavourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some\\r\\ndecided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet\\r\\nhim at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and\\r\\ntrick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\\r\\nChurchill's part.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\\r\\nand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short\\r\\nword prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He\\r\\nsaw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,\\r\\nthough it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;\\r\\nfor she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense! for shame!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He heard Frank Churchill next say,\\r\\nwith a glance towards Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will give it to her--shall I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and as\\r\\nclearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, you\\r\\nmust not; you shall not, indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\\r\\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\\r\\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\\r\\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity\\r\\nto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\\r\\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it\\r\\nto be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his;\\r\\nher comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,\\r\\nthe superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\\r\\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\\r\\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not\\r\\nknow that proper names were allowed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pushed away the letters with even\\r\\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\\r\\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\\r\\nattack, and turned towards her aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, very true, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\\r\\na word--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\\r\\ngoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\\r\\nfor us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\\r\\nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\\r\\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but\\r\\nso many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley\\r\\nthought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards\\r\\nher, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards\\r\\nlooking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing\\r\\ndusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley\\r\\ncould not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of\\r\\nwhat he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\\r\\nobservations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--an anxious\\r\\nfriend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\\r\\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\\r\\nhis duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, Emma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\\r\\npoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the\\r\\nword, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the\\r\\none, and so very distressing to the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\\r\\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was\\r\\nreally ashamed of having ever imparted them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried in evident embarrassment, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit all meant nothing; a mere\\r\\njoke among ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe joke,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied gravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseemed confined to you and Mr.\\r\\nChurchill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\\r\\nbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\\r\\ndoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitless\\r\\ninterference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to\\r\\ndeclare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her,\\r\\nto risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,\\r\\nrather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the\\r\\nremembrance of neglect in such a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Emma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he at last, with earnest kindness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo you\\r\\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\\r\\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetween Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why\\r\\ndo you make a doubt of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\\r\\nthat she admired him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever, never!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried with a most open eagerness--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever, for the\\r\\ntwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\\r\\nit possibly come into your head?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\\r\\nthem--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\\r\\npublic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\\r\\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry\\r\\nto check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is no\\r\\nadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\\r\\nhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings\\r\\nrather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to\\r\\nexplain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which is\\r\\ncapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\\r\\nfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\\r\\nthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\\r\\ncan _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's\\r\\nindifference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\\r\\nwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\\r\\nprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\\r\\nsuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\\r\\ncircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\\r\\nhers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\\r\\nirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\\r\\nfever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost\\r\\nevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\\r\\nleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nSuckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\\r\\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\\r\\nimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\\r\\npresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted\\r\\nto the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had\\r\\nbeen united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health\\r\\nseemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much\\r\\nincreased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was\\r\\nby the approach of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\\r\\nof pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\\r\\nwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\\r\\nat first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\\r\\nneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though\\r\\nthe Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\\r\\nautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\\r\\nto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\\r\\nidea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what\\r\\nevery body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\\r\\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the\\r\\nchosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a\\r\\nquiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and\\r\\npreparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the\\r\\nEltons and the Sucklings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\\r\\nfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston\\r\\nthat he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had\\r\\nfailed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that\\r\\nas Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she\\r\\nhad no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great\\r\\ndislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly\\r\\naware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done\\r\\nwithout a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and\\r\\nshe found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which\\r\\nshe would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\\r\\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.\\r\\nElton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her\\r\\noutward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her\\r\\nreflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you approve of what I have done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he very comfortably.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\\r\\nnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\\r\\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\\r\\nleave her out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\\r\\nwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\\r\\npigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\\r\\ninto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\\r\\nbefore the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\\r\\non, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were\\r\\ninadequate to such an attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs not this most vexatious, Knightley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd such weather\\r\\nfor exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\\r\\nare we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing\\r\\ndone. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\\r\\nexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better explore to Donwell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Knightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat may\\r\\nbe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening\\r\\nfast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\\r\\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I should like\\r\\nit of all things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\\r\\nfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\\r\\nbut no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\\r\\nthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\\r\\nand again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely\\r\\ngratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\\r\\nas she chose to consider it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may depend upon me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly will come. Name your\\r\\nday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot name a day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctill I have spoken to some others whom\\r\\nI would wish to meet you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am Lady\\r\\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you will bring Elton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I will not trouble you to\\r\\ngive any other invitations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid\\r\\nof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\\r\\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave\\r\\nit all to me. I will invite your guests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--he calmly replied,--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is but one married woman in the world\\r\\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\\r\\nthat one is--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such\\r\\nmatters myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! you are an odd creature!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, satisfied to have no one\\r\\npreferred to herself.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a humourist, and may say what you\\r\\nlike. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her\\r\\naunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\\r\\nthe Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss\\r\\nBates in my way home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It\\r\\nis to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\\r\\nshall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\\r\\non my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\\r\\nmore simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\\r\\nno form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about\\r\\nyour gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\\r\\ntrees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\\r\\nof doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\\r\\nand simple as possible. Is not that your idea?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\\r\\nthe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\\r\\ngentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\\r\\nbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\\r\\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye,\\r\\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be\\r\\nsincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect\\r\\nanything--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\\r\\nclever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\\r\\nwould spurn any body's assistance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\\r\\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I\\r\\nreally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life\\r\\nI conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever\\r\\nso many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\\r\\nhome;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in\\r\\nwinter there is dirt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is\\r\\nnever dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if\\r\\nyou prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to\\r\\nbe as much to your taste as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\\r\\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\\r\\nwarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,\\r\\nbelieve me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\\r\\nthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\\r\\nwished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\\r\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to\\r\\neat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\\r\\nspecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\\r\\nDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for\\r\\nhis easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two\\r\\nyears. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\\r\\nvery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls\\r\\nwalked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now,\\r\\nin the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again\\r\\nexceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and\\r\\nany other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to\\r\\nhis, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He\\r\\nthought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind\\r\\nand sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining\\r\\nout.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The\\r\\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\\r\\nMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\\r\\nto themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\\r\\npleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to\\r\\njoin them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could\\r\\nhave been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that\\r\\nhe should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in\\r\\nwriting, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\\r\\nBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\\r\\nsettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing\\r\\nexactly right.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\\r\\nsafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\\r\\nthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\\r\\nAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\\r\\nhappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\\r\\nhad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\\r\\nto heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\\r\\npurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when\\r\\nall the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\\r\\nsympathiser.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was\\r\\nsatisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look\\r\\naround her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular\\r\\nobservation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must\\r\\never be so interesting to her and all her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\\r\\nthe present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\\r\\nthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\\r\\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens\\r\\nstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\\r\\nall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance\\r\\nof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\\r\\nhad rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\\r\\nit, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\\r\\ncomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought\\r\\nto be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\\r\\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\\r\\nin blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\\r\\nbut Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\\r\\nneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were\\r\\npleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\\r\\nwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\\r\\nstrawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\\r\\nChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\\r\\nin all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,\\r\\nwas very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\\r\\ntalking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\\r\\nspoken of.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe best fruit in England--every body's favourite--always\\r\\nwholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to\\r\\ngather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning\\r\\ndecidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy\\r\\ninfinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboys\\r\\nvery scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--price\\r\\nof strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple\\r\\nGrove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly\\r\\ndifferent--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their\\r\\nway--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior\\r\\nto cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering\\r\\nstrawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no\\r\\nlonger--must go and sit in the shade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by\\r\\nMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\\r\\ninquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some\\r\\nfears of his horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\\r\\nto overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A\\r\\nsituation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had\\r\\nreceived notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not\\r\\nwith Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and\\r\\nsplendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.\\r\\nBragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.\\r\\nDelightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,\\r\\nevery thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\\r\\nimmediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she\\r\\npositively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax\\r\\ncontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\\r\\nthing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\\r\\nbefore.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\\r\\nacquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was\\r\\nastonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and\\r\\nat last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\\r\\nremoval.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShould not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\\r\\ngardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--The\\r\\npertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\\r\\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one\\r\\nanother to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which\\r\\nstretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed\\r\\nthe finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a\\r\\nview at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed\\r\\nintended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to\\r\\nthe house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be\\r\\nthe taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and\\r\\nthe view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at\\r\\nnearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\\r\\nform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of\\r\\nconsiderable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at\\r\\nthe bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the\\r\\nAbbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and\\r\\nhandsome curve around it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\\r\\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being\\r\\noppressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\\r\\ntowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\\r\\ndistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\\r\\nHarriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--There\\r\\nhad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\\r\\nturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\\r\\nconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry\\r\\nto see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now\\r\\nshe feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of\\r\\nprosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in\\r\\nblossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the\\r\\nwall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He\\r\\nwas giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma\\r\\nreceived a smile which seemed to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are my own concerns. I have\\r\\na right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of\\r\\nintroducing Robert Martin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--She did not suspect him. It was too old\\r\\na story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They\\r\\ntook a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most\\r\\nrefreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and they\\r\\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\\r\\nWeston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\\r\\nuneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\\r\\nthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\\r\\ncoming, with more than common certainty. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis aunt was so much better,\\r\\nthat he had not a doubt of getting over to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Mrs. Churchill's\\r\\nstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\\r\\nsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\\r\\ndependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\\r\\nthat it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was\\r\\nprevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under\\r\\nconsideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\\r\\nwhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far\\r\\nas the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\\r\\nany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\\r\\nof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him,\\r\\nstirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that\\r\\nMrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and\\r\\nvariety which her spirits seemed to need.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's\\r\\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\\r\\nshells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\\r\\nprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness\\r\\nhad perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.\\r\\nMrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them\\r\\nall to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than\\r\\nin a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and\\r\\nmethodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma\\r\\nwalked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of\\r\\nthe entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when\\r\\nJane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a\\r\\nlook of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there\\r\\nwas a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in\\r\\nquest of.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you be so kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen I am missed, as to say that I am\\r\\ngone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it\\r\\nis, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,\\r\\nand I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any\\r\\nbody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the\\r\\nponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be\\r\\nmissed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am\\r\\ngone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury\\r\\nalone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\\r\\nminutes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\\r\\nfather's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be\\r\\nround in five minutes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And\\r\\nfor _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to\\r\\nguard others!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\r\\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\\r\\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--she answered--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\\r\\nfatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know\\r\\nat times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\\r\\nexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have\\r\\nmy own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\\r\\nher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and\\r\\nwatched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\\r\\ngrateful--and her parting words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\\r\\nbeing sometimes alone!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\\r\\nto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\\r\\neven towards some of those who loved her best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch a home, indeed! such an aunt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, as she turned back into\\r\\nthe hall again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\\r\\ntheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\\r\\naccomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank\\r\\nChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\\r\\nforgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\\r\\nwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right\\r\\nwho had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by\\r\\na temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\\r\\nlasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\\r\\ntill very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and\\r\\nhow late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\\r\\ncome at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\\r\\nlike it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him\\r\\nlike heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\\r\\nintolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\\r\\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\\r\\nspared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\\r\\ngoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\\r\\ncame--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's\\r\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\\r\\nhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\\r\\nhis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\\r\\nthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking\\r\\nsome refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\\r\\ndining-room--and she humanely pointed out the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo--he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\\r\\nhotter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\\r\\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her\\r\\nattention to her father, saying in secret--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\\r\\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper\\r\\nwill not mind it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\\r\\nback all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like\\r\\nhimself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\\r\\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\\r\\nHe was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\\r\\nat last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\\r\\nover views in Swisserland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall\\r\\nnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\\r\\nsketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my\\r\\npoem. I shall do something to expose myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\\r\\nSwisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\\r\\nher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\\r\\nassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\\r\\nshall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\\r\\nwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\\r\\neyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if\\r\\nI could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\\r\\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\\r\\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted\\r\\nin every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\\r\\nperson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\\r\\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of\\r\\ncold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on\\r\\na par with the rest of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is not\\r\\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of\\r\\na change. You will stay, and go with us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen pray stay at Richmond.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you\\r\\nall there without me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\\r\\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\\r\\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\\r\\ntook it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\\r\\ndisturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it was\\r\\ntime for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final\\r\\narrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's\\r\\nlittle inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last\\r\\nwords to Emma were,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond\\r\\nwas to take him back before the following evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\\r\\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\\r\\nfavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\\r\\nsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\\r\\ntime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\\r\\nthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\\r\\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\\r\\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\\r\\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,\\r\\na want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much\\r\\ninto parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of\\r\\nMiss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\\r\\nAnd Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed\\r\\nat first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable\\r\\nas they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the\\r\\nhill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,\\r\\ntoo strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any\\r\\ncheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\\r\\nChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing--looked\\r\\nwithout seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing\\r\\nwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\\r\\nshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\\r\\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\\r\\nEvery distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\\r\\nTo amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared\\r\\nfor--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay\\r\\nand easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission\\r\\nto be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating\\r\\nperiod of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation,\\r\\nmeant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must\\r\\nhave had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very\\r\\nwell describe. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together\\r\\nexcessively.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and\\r\\nto having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to\\r\\nIreland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any\\r\\nreal felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had\\r\\nexpected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked\\r\\nhim for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\\r\\nadmiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning\\r\\nback her heart. She still intended him for her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much I am obliged to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor telling me to come\\r\\nto-day!--If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\\r\\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you\\r\\nwere too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you\\r\\ndeserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is hotter to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are comfortable because you are under command.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour command?--Yes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\\r\\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\\r\\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot be always\\r\\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\\r\\nrather than mine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\\r\\nmotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\\r\\nwith me. You are always with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\\r\\nbegin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\\r\\nfirst in February.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody\\r\\nspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\\r\\nnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say nothing of which I am ashamed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he, with lively\\r\\nimpudence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\\r\\nhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,\\r\\nand Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then\\r\\nwhispering--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do\\r\\nto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies\\r\\nand gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\\r\\npresides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\\r\\nof?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\\r\\ndeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's answer was the most distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\\r\\nthinking of?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, no\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon no\\r\\naccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\\r\\nof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking\\r\\nof. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing\\r\\nat Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of\\r\\nknowing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a sort of thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich _I_\\r\\nshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\\r\\nperhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--_I_ never was in any\\r\\ncircle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard\\r\\nof--but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every\\r\\nbody knows what is due to _you_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will not do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whispered Frank to Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are most of them\\r\\naffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--I\\r\\nam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\\r\\nknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\\r\\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\\r\\nare seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\\r\\nentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\\r\\nthing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two\\r\\nthings moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and she\\r\\nengages to laugh heartily at them all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Miss Bates, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen I need not be uneasy.\\r\\n'Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. I\\r\\nshall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\\r\\nshan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every\\r\\nbody's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not resist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be\\r\\nlimited as to number--only three at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\\r\\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\\r\\nanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\\r\\nKnightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\\r\\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like your plan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgreed, agreed. I will do my\\r\\nbest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLow, I am afraid, sir, very low,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered his son;--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut we shall be\\r\\nindulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\\r\\nWeston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\\r\\nhear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI doubt its being very clever myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is too much\\r\\na matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are\\r\\nthere, that express perfection?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\\r\\nguess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\\r\\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\\r\\nenjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch\\r\\nthe rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\\r\\nKnightley gravely said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\\r\\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\\r\\nelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Elton; \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_\\r\\nreally cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\\r\\nan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\\r\\npleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know\\r\\nwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very\\r\\nwell at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\\r\\nplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty\\r\\nthings at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a\\r\\ngreat deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to\\r\\njudge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,\\r\\nMr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing\\r\\nclever to say--not one of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, pray pass _me_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added her husband, with a sort of sneering\\r\\nconsciousness; \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man--quite good for\\r\\nnothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\\r\\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHappy couple!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\\r\\nhearing:--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they\\r\\ndid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew\\r\\neach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to\\r\\nany real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public\\r\\nplace, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\\r\\nonly by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\\r\\nthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\\r\\nis all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\\r\\nhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\\r\\nof his life!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\\r\\nconfederates, spoke now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch things do occur, undoubtedly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--She was stopped by a cough. Frank\\r\\nChurchill turned towards her to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were speaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\\r\\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be\\r\\nvery frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there is\\r\\ngenerally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to\\r\\nmean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness\\r\\nmust be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate\\r\\nacquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\\r\\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\\r\\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to\\r\\nEmma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body\\r\\nfixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at\\r\\nhis father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd make her like myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy all means, if you can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\\r\\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come\\r\\nto you for my wife. Remember.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\\r\\nfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\\r\\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\\r\\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say?\\r\\nReferring the education to her seemed to imply it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, ma'am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane to her aunt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall we join Mrs. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\\r\\nready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\\r\\nsoon overtake her. There she is--no, that's somebody else. That's one\\r\\nof the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--Well, I\\r\\ndeclare--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,\\r\\nhis son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits\\r\\nnow rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of\\r\\nflattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about\\r\\nwith any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended\\r\\nto, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. The\\r\\nappearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the\\r\\ncarriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and\\r\\npreparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_\\r\\ncarriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive\\r\\nhome which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of\\r\\npleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\\r\\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\\r\\nlooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\\r\\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.\\r\\nI cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be\\r\\nso unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to\\r\\na woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought\\r\\nit possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\\r\\nIt was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of\\r\\nit since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--with what\\r\\ncandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\\r\\nforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\\r\\never receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\\r\\nso irksome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know there is not a better creature in the world:\\r\\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\\r\\nunfortunately blended in her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are blended,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\\r\\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\\r\\nthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\\r\\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\\r\\nliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, Emma,\\r\\nconsider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\\r\\nfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\\r\\nprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\\r\\nbadly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had\\r\\nseen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you\\r\\nnow, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her,\\r\\nhumble her--and before her niece, too--and before others, many of whom\\r\\n(certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\\r\\nof her.--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from\\r\\npleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\\r\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\\r\\ntrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you\\r\\ncan do now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\\r\\nready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\\r\\nmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\\r\\ntongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\\r\\nmortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, on\\r\\nentering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproaching\\r\\nherself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in\\r\\napparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a\\r\\ndifference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and the horses\\r\\nwere in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with\\r\\nwhat appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and\\r\\nevery thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been\\r\\nexpressed--almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so\\r\\nagitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was\\r\\nmost forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no\\r\\ndenying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal,\\r\\nso cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill\\r\\nopinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without\\r\\nsaying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!\\r\\n\\r\\nTime did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\\r\\nit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\\r\\nto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\\r\\nfagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\\r\\ndown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to\\r\\ncheck them, extraordinary as they were.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the\\r\\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\\r\\nnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\\r\\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was\\r\\na morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\\r\\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\\r\\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father,\\r\\nwas felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she\\r\\nwas giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and\\r\\nfeeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and\\r\\nconfiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any\\r\\nsevere reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.\\r\\nShe hoped no one could have said to her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow could you be so unfeeling\\r\\nto your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miss\\r\\nBates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do\\r\\naway the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss,\\r\\nher conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;\\r\\nscornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true\\r\\ncontrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should\\r\\nbe the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\\r\\nnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\\r\\nmight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in\\r\\nwhile she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\\r\\nashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\\r\\nHer eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ladies were all at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She had never rejoiced at the sound\\r\\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\\r\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\\r\\nderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\\r\\nShe heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\\r\\nmaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a\\r\\nmoment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both\\r\\nescaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of,\\r\\nlooking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard\\r\\nMiss Bates saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down upon\\r\\nthe bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not\\r\\nquite understand what was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid Jane is not very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I do not know; they\\r\\n_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am\\r\\nvery little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I\\r\\nam sure she will be here presently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss Bates\\r\\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery happy and\\r\\nobliged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the same\\r\\ncheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A very\\r\\nfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\\r\\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and\\r\\nare come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\\r\\nme--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us\\r\\nto part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\\r\\nheadache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you\\r\\nknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. 'My dear,' said\\r\\nI, 'you will blind yourself'--for tears were in her eyes perpetually.\\r\\nOne cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though\\r\\nshe is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no\\r\\nyoung woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us\\r\\nungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again\\r\\ndispersing her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a\\r\\nheadache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\\r\\nany blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To\\r\\nlook at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have\\r\\nsecured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you--she is\\r\\nnot able--she is gone into her own room--I want her to lie down upon the\\r\\nbed. 'My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:'\\r\\nbut, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that\\r\\nshe has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will\\r\\nbe extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your\\r\\nkindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite\\r\\nashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that\\r\\nwe had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not\\r\\nknow any body was coming. 'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend upon\\r\\nit. Nobody else would come so early.' 'Well,' said she, 'it must be\\r\\nborne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then Patty\\r\\ncame in, and said it was you. 'Oh!' said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I am\\r\\nsure you will like to see her.'--'I can see nobody,' said she; and\\r\\nup she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you\\r\\nwaiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. 'If you must go, my\\r\\ndear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the\\r\\nbed.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\\r\\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\r\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but\\r\\npity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of\\r\\nthe past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on\\r\\nseeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear\\r\\nto see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and\\r\\nsolicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected\\r\\nfrom Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for\\r\\nMiss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must be a severe\\r\\ntrial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel\\r\\nCampbell's return.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo very kind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Bates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you are always kind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no bearing such an \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to break through her dreadful\\r\\ngratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge\\r\\nof her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible that any\\r\\nsituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\\r\\nMrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. Smallridge is\\r\\nintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four\\r\\nmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\\r\\nwould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane\\r\\nfirst heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning\\r\\nwe were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided\\r\\nagainst accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly\\r\\nas you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel\\r\\nCampbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any\\r\\nengagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\\r\\nagain--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\\r\\nmind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\\r\\nfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\\r\\nsuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she\\r\\npositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\\r\\nJane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\\r\\nwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\\r\\nthe least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\\r\\nupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she\\r\\nhad come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it\\r\\ntill it was all settled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\\r\\nthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 'You _must_\\r\\n_all_ spend your evening with us,' said she--'I positively must have you\\r\\n_all_ come.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Knightley was there too, was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\\r\\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him\\r\\noff, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and\\r\\na very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\\r\\nrather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, is\\r\\nfatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\\r\\nenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\\r\\nand feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\\r\\nmaking up her mind the whole day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say she had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\\r\\nfriends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\\r\\npossible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing\\r\\nin the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\\r\\nBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\\r\\nand elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\\r\\ndelightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as\\r\\nto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\\r\\nare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\\r\\nsuch regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\\r\\npleasure.--And her salary!--I really cannot venture to name her salary\\r\\nto you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\\r\\nhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif other children are at all like what I\\r\\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\\r\\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\\r\\nearned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are so noble in your ideas!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a\\r\\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not\\r\\nknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\\r\\nsay, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\\r\\nMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their\\r\\nreturn?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation\\r\\nas she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished\\r\\nwhen she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when\\r\\nMrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was\\r\\nbefore tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were\\r\\njust going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember\\r\\nthinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened\\r\\nbefore tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before\\r\\ntea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I\\r\\nhave a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven\\r\\nyears; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the\\r\\nrheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so will\\r\\nJane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to\\r\\ntalk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do\\r\\nhimself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\\r\\nof that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\\r\\nand so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been\\r\\ntelling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to\\r\\nRandalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened\\r\\nbefore tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\\r\\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\\r\\ncould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's\\r\\ngoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\\r\\naccumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\\r\\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\\r\\nsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,\\r\\nhowever, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\\r\\nsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\\r\\naccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\\r\\nback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\\r\\nresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\\r\\nseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\\r\\nCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\\r\\ngoing a good pace, and driving very steady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\\r\\ncaught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already\\r\\nengaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in\\r\\nthe world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the\\r\\nother nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny,\\r\\nand quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss\\r\\nBates's saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\\r\\nof that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--'You\\r\\nmust go,' said she. 'You and I must part. You will have no business\\r\\nhere.--Let it stay, however,' said she; 'give it houseroom till Colonel\\r\\nCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\\r\\nme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--And to this day, I do\\r\\nbelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\\r\\nall her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\\r\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough;\\r\\nand, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of\\r\\nthe good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\\r\\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\\r\\nKnightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\\r\\nwith her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\\r\\ndecidedly graver than usual, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\\r\\nand therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\\r\\na few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\\r\\nbesides the 'love,' which nobody carries?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\\r\\nhowever, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\\r\\nagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father\\r\\nbegan his inquiries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my\\r\\nworthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.\\r\\nand Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\\r\\nattentive to them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a\\r\\nsmile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\\r\\nKnightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\\r\\nher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\\r\\nhad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\\r\\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified--and in\\r\\nanother moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\\r\\nfriendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--whether she had not\\r\\nherself made the first motion, she could not say--she might, perhaps,\\r\\nhave rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly\\r\\nwas on the point of carrying it to his lips--when, from some fancy or\\r\\nother, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple, why\\r\\nhe should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not\\r\\nperceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not\\r\\nstopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was\\r\\nthat his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\\r\\nhappened, but she thought nothing became him more.--It was with him,\\r\\nof so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She could not but recall the\\r\\nattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He left\\r\\nthem immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He always moved with the\\r\\nalertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\\r\\nnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\\r\\nhad left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure\\r\\nto talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither\\r\\nwould she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she\\r\\nknew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened\\r\\nat a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\\r\\npleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she could not\\r\\nbe deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\\r\\ngallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\\r\\nhis good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\\r\\nfound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness\\r\\nof Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on\\r\\nhorseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her\\r\\nnews of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified;\\r\\nit supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He\\r\\nhad long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and\\r\\ncould talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had\\r\\nbeen an unexpected blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\\r\\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\\r\\nher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\\r\\nsituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\\r\\nbe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.\\r\\nYou know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\\r\\nwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\\r\\ninduced to go away after it has been her home so long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\\r\\ninto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\\r\\ndeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\\r\\nto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\\r\\nhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\\r\\nthing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\\r\\nstruggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\\r\\ngravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\\r\\nsurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\\r\\nshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\\r\\nto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\\r\\ndisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\\r\\nMrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\\r\\nnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\\r\\njustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\\r\\nevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\\r\\nimaginary complaints.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\\r\\nmore than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the\\r\\ntemper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, what\\r\\nwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be\\r\\ndreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Even Mr.\\r\\nWeston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! poor woman,\\r\\nwho would have thought it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and resolved, that his mourning should be as\\r\\nhandsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her\\r\\nbroad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it\\r\\nwould affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also\\r\\na very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,\\r\\nthe grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them both with awe and\\r\\ncompassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might\\r\\nbe affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment\\r\\nall the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have\\r\\nnothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared\\r\\nby nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his\\r\\nnephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\\r\\nthe attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\\r\\nno certainty of its being already formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\\r\\nWhat ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma\\r\\nwas gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\\r\\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\\r\\nThey spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual\\r\\nforbearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\\r\\nthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\\r\\nwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\\r\\ndeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very\\r\\nold friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\\r\\nvisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\\r\\nHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\\r\\non Emma's side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\\r\\nprospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements\\r\\nnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\\r\\nkindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\\r\\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\\r\\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\\r\\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\\r\\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify\\r\\nrespect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day\\r\\nat Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,\\r\\nand by a verbal message. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Fairfax was not well enough to write;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared\\r\\nthat she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against\\r\\nher own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe\\r\\nheadaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the\\r\\npossibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.\\r\\nHer health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite\\r\\ngone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing\\r\\ntouching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension\\r\\nof the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had\\r\\nundertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself,\\r\\nthough she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\\r\\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\\r\\ndisorder:--confined always to one room;--he could have wished it\\r\\notherwise--and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\\r\\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\\r\\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\\r\\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\\r\\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\\r\\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\\r\\nway of being useful. To take her--be it only an hour or two--from\\r\\nher aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\\r\\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\\r\\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\\r\\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\\r\\nhour that Jane would name--mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided\\r\\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was only\\r\\nin this short note:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\\r\\nexercise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\\r\\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\\r\\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\\r\\ncounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\\r\\nanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,\\r\\nin the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would not\\r\\ndo;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\\r\\nwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\\r\\nservice--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in\\r\\nvain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was\\r\\nquite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\\r\\nworse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\\r\\nbut, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\\r\\nthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\\r\\nbody--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and\\r\\nMrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,\\r\\nexcept them, Jane would really see nobody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\\r\\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\\r\\nshe feel any right of preference herself--she submitted, therefore, and\\r\\nonly questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet,\\r\\nwhich she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\\r\\nwas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\\r\\nthing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing\\r\\nthey could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\\r\\ndistasteful.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\\r\\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\r\\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half\\r\\nan hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss\\r\\nBates, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent\\r\\nback; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover, she insisted on\\r\\nher saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\\r\\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\\r\\nthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\\r\\nexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\\r\\nshe could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was\\r\\nresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\\r\\nHer heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\\r\\nfrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\\r\\ninequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\\r\\ncredit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but\\r\\nshe had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of\\r\\nbeing able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy\\r\\nto all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen\\r\\ninto her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to\\r\\nreprove.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was\\r\\ncalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccould not stay five minutes,\\r\\nand wanted particularly to speak with her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--He met her at the\\r\\nparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of\\r\\nhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be\\r\\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs she unwell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\\r\\ncarriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\\r\\nknow--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\\r\\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really not\\r\\nill?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDepend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\\r\\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\\r\\nreally important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\\r\\nwell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,\\r\\nthat she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of\\r\\nthe house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow\\r\\nMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--he gravely replied.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't ask me. I promised my wife to\\r\\nleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\\r\\nbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBreak it to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, standing still with terror.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood\\r\\nGod!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick\\r\\nSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it\\r\\nis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed you are mistaken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\\r\\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?--I charge you\\r\\nby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, Emma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that\\r\\nit has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be\\r\\n_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my honour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he very seriously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit does not. It is not in\\r\\nthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\\r\\nKnightley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's courage returned, and she walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin talking of its being _broke_ to you.\\r\\nI should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\\r\\nyou--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my\\r\\ndear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't\\r\\nsay that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much\\r\\nworse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\\r\\nasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\\r\\nthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\\r\\nconcern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\\r\\ncircumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond\\r\\nhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\\r\\nchildren, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very\\r\\nundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more\\r\\nthan an animating curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is that gentleman on horseback?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, as they\\r\\nproceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\\r\\nthan with any other view.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I\\r\\nassure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this\\r\\ntime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas your son been with you, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\\r\\nand demure,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe, as they entered the room--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have brought her, and now I hope you\\r\\nwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\\r\\ndelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--And Emma distinctly\\r\\nheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\nbeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\\r\\nthat Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\\r\\neagerly said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\\r\\nfind, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have been\\r\\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.\\r\\nDo not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\\r\\ndistress, whatever it may be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you indeed no idea?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\\r\\nhear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has\\r\\nbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\\r\\nimpossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\\r\\nsubject,--to announce an attachment--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\\r\\nHarriet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMore than an attachment, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d resumed Mrs. Weston; \\xe2\\x80\\x9can\\r\\nengagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will\\r\\nany body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\\r\\nengaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may well be amazed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\\r\\nand talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn\\r\\nengagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and\\r\\nkept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\\r\\nthemselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--It is so\\r\\nwonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost\\r\\nincredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two\\r\\nideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\\r\\npoor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\\r\\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she at last, trying to recover herself; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is a\\r\\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\\r\\nall comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either\\r\\nof them came to Highbury?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEngaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very\\r\\nmuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\\r\\ncannot excuse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not pretend _not_ to\\r\\nunderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\\r\\nthat no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\\r\\napprehensive of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as\\r\\nsteady as her words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\\r\\npresent perfect indifference,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will farther tell you,\\r\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\\r\\ndid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,\\r\\nwas attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\\r\\nFortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\\r\\nfor at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\\r\\nbelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\\r\\nutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\\r\\nthan any thing else in the world could do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn\\r\\nthis point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\\r\\nmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\\r\\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\\r\\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\\r\\nand I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he\\r\\nto come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners\\r\\nso _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as\\r\\nhe certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\\r\\nattention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to\\r\\nanother?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How could\\r\\nhe tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong,\\r\\nvery wrong indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!\\r\\nto look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\\r\\nbefore her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\\r\\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\\r\\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow\\r\\nthe full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been\\r\\nmisunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,\\r\\nseemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\\r\\npossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, much\\r\\nbeyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\\r\\nin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that upright\\r\\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of\\r\\ntrick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of\\r\\nhis life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\\r\\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\\r\\nmany, very many, good qualities; and--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, not attending to her.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Smallridge, too!\\r\\nJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\\r\\nsuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer her\\r\\neven to think of such a measure!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\\r\\nhim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or at\\r\\nleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, I\\r\\nknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do\\r\\nnot know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of\\r\\nwhat she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him\\r\\nto come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\\r\\nhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\\r\\nconcealment that had been carrying on so long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma began to listen better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am to hear from him soon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe told me at\\r\\nparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\\r\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\\r\\nus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\\r\\nmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to\\r\\nbe understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to\\r\\ncondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\\r\\nsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\\r\\nfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\\r\\nboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\\r\\nconcealment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_His_ sufferings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma dryly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo not appear to have done him\\r\\nmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely a\\r\\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!\\r\\nWhile poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a\\r\\nhope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in\\r\\nthe family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite\\r\\nto what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue\\r\\ninfluence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with very\\r\\nlittle persuasion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che would have done as much for Harriet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\\r\\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and\\r\\nthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\\r\\nto whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\\r\\nhe could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very much\\r\\nagitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quite\\r\\na different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In\\r\\naddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\\r\\nvery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was\\r\\nevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such\\r\\nperfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of\\r\\nthe engagement?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in\\r\\nthe world but their two selves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\\r\\nidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a\\r\\nvery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\\r\\nhypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with\\r\\nprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret\\r\\nto judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\\r\\ncompletely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\\r\\nand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\\r\\ncarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\\r\\nwords that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the\\r\\nconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\\r\\nperfectly agreeable!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am quite easy on that head,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sure\\r\\nthat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not\\r\\nhave heard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\\r\\nimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\\r\\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\\r\\nas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\\r\\nevidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him\\r\\nin; and, while he was coming round, added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, dearest Emma, let me\\r\\nintreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease,\\r\\nand incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of\\r\\nit--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It\\r\\nis not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,\\r\\nwhy should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for\\r\\nFrank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such\\r\\nsteadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her\\r\\ncredit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of\\r\\nthis one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may\\r\\nbe said in her situation for even that error!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch, indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma feelingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a woman can ever be\\r\\nexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\\r\\nFairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's,\\r\\nnor the world's law.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\\r\\nexclaiming,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\\r\\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of\\r\\nguessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\\r\\nyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\\r\\ncondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate\\r\\nyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the\\r\\nmost lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\\r\\nright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was\\r\\nimmediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook\\r\\nher heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in\\r\\na manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think\\r\\nthe engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what\\r\\ncould palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they\\r\\nhad talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again\\r\\nwith Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly\\r\\nreconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank\\r\\ncould possibly have done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet, poor Harriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Those were the words; in them lay the\\r\\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\\r\\nthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very\\r\\nill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_\\r\\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\\r\\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the\\r\\ndeepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the\\r\\ndupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\\r\\nprophetically, when he once said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma, you have been no friend\\r\\nto Harriet Smith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--She was afraid she had done her nothing but\\r\\ndisservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\\r\\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\\r\\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\\r\\nnever have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\\r\\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\\r\\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty\\r\\nof having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\\r\\nprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\\r\\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\\r\\nto have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend's\\r\\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed\\r\\nher to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him,\\r\\nand that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring\\r\\nfor her.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, with common sense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I have had\\r\\nlittle to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\\r\\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane\\r\\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\\r\\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need\\r\\nno longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\\r\\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her\\r\\ndays of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and\\r\\nhappy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\\r\\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\\r\\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival;\\r\\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\\r\\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\\r\\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\\r\\nunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\\r\\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\\r\\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\\r\\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little\\r\\nsympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\\r\\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\\r\\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\\r\\njudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing\\r\\nreserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful\\r\\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\\r\\nbeen among Mr. Weston's parting words. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the present, the whole\\r\\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\\r\\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\\r\\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Emma had\\r\\npromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\\r\\nridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\\r\\noffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by\\r\\nherself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\\r\\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick\\r\\non hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs.\\r\\nWeston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event of\\r\\nthe disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,\\r\\nthere could be no chance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Miss Woodhouse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cis\\r\\nnot this the oddest news that ever was?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat news do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\\r\\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you\\r\\nneed not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\\r\\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\\r\\nand, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,\\r\\nbut he said you knew it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did Mr. Weston tell you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--said Emma, still perplexed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\\r\\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\\r\\nanother this long while. How very odd!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,\\r\\nthat Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\\r\\nabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\\r\\ndisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\\r\\nher, quite unable to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad you any idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof his being in love with her?--You,\\r\\nperhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\\r\\nbody's heart; but nobody else--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI begin to doubt my having any such talent.\\r\\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\\r\\nto another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not\\r\\nopenly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never\\r\\nhad the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\\r\\nChurchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\\r\\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should you caution\\r\\nme?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nEmma, smiling; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and\\r\\nnot very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you\\r\\ndid care about him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHim!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n turning away distressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, after a moment's pause--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?--Good\\r\\nHeaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\\r\\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\\r\\nher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\\r\\nin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not have thought it possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you could have\\r\\nmisunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him--but considering\\r\\nhow infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have\\r\\nthought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in\\r\\nthe company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should\\r\\nhave been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that\\r\\nyou entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I\\r\\nshould have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\\r\\nto dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more\\r\\nwonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater\\r\\ndisparity (those were your very words);--I should not have dared to\\r\\ngive way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who\\r\\nhad been always acquainted with him--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us understand\\r\\neach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\\r\\nspeaking of--Mr. Knightley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and so\\r\\nI thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\\r\\npossible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Emma, with forced calmness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor all that you then\\r\\nsaid, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost\\r\\nassert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the\\r\\ngipsies, was spoken of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\\r\\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;\\r\\nthat considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\\r\\nnatural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\\r\\nyour sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had\\r\\nbeen in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is\\r\\nstrong on my memory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Harriet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow I recollect what you mean; but I\\r\\nwas thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\\r\\ngipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\\r\\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\\r\\nstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\\r\\nwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that\\r\\nwas the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every\\r\\nother being upon earth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis has been a most unfortunate--most\\r\\ndeplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\\r\\nleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\\r\\nother had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she resumed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you should feel a\\r\\ngreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\\r\\nthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\\r\\nI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may\\r\\nappear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\\r\\nthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than\\r\\nbetween Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such\\r\\na thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so\\r\\nfortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if\\r\\n_he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will\\r\\nnot set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But\\r\\nyou are too good for that, I am sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at\\r\\nher in consternation, and hastily said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must say that I\\r\\nhave.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\\r\\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\\r\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers,\\r\\nonce opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched--she\\r\\nadmitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse\\r\\nthat Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank\\r\\nChurchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having\\r\\nsome hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of an\\r\\narrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\\r\\nfew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\\r\\nher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\\r\\ninconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\\r\\nher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her\\r\\nwith dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the\\r\\nworld. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all\\r\\nthese demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense\\r\\nof justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the\\r\\ngirl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\\r\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the\\r\\nresolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent\\r\\nkindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost\\r\\nextent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done\\r\\nnothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily\\r\\nformed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose\\r\\ncounsels had never led her right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,\\r\\nand subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more\\r\\ninviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which\\r\\nhad first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was\\r\\nquite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\\r\\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and\\r\\nsuch a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give\\r\\nthe history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's\\r\\ntremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than\\r\\nHarriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her\\r\\nmind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such\\r\\na burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing\\r\\nemotions, must create.--She listened with much inward suffering, but\\r\\nwith great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well\\r\\narranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it\\r\\ncontained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of\\r\\nthe narration, a substance to sink her spirit--especially with the\\r\\ncorroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of\\r\\nMr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\r\\nthose two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\\r\\nfound her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\\r\\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him,\\r\\nHarriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he\\r\\nhad been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner\\r\\ntowards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been\\r\\nmore and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,\\r\\nhe had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\\r\\ndelightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\\r\\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\\r\\nalmost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbation\\r\\nand praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement\\r\\nwith what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for\\r\\nbeing without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\\r\\nfeelings.--She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he\\r\\nhad dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's\\r\\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\\r\\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment\\r\\nimplied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\\r\\nby Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,\\r\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\\r\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to\\r\\nbe mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without\\r\\nsome degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking\\r\\nwith her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they\\r\\nhad been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as\\r\\nshe was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first,\\r\\nhe had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done\\r\\nbefore, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall\\r\\nit without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her\\r\\naffections were engaged.--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared\\r\\nlikely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about\\r\\nfarming:--The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half\\r\\nan hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of\\r\\nhis being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that\\r\\nhe could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their\\r\\nconversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against\\r\\nhis inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as\\r\\nEmma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The superior degree of\\r\\nconfidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her\\r\\nsevere pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\\r\\nlittle reflection, venture the following question. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight he not?--Is\\r\\nnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\\r\\nyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might have\\r\\nMr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\\r\\nspirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\\r\\nknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never should have presumed to think of it at first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\\r\\nbe the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\\r\\ndeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\\r\\nvery wonderful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,\\r\\nmade the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to say\\r\\non reply,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHarriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last\\r\\nman in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his\\r\\nfeeling for her more than he really does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\\r\\nsatisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\\r\\nat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\\r\\nfather's footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\\r\\nmuch agitated to encounter him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe could not compose herself--\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--with most ready\\r\\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another\\r\\ndoor--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of\\r\\nEmma's feelings: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh God! that I had never seen her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\\r\\nthoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\\r\\nrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\\r\\nfresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\\r\\nher.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\\r\\nbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the\\r\\nblindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about,\\r\\nshe tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every\\r\\nposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\\r\\nbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\\r\\nbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she\\r\\nwas wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\\r\\nwretchedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\\r\\nendeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father's\\r\\nclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\\r\\ndeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?--\\r\\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\\r\\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\\r\\nshe compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in her\\r\\nestimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--and as\\r\\nthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it--oh! had it, by\\r\\nany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.--She\\r\\nsaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\\r\\nKnightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not\\r\\nbeen infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\\r\\nin fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\\r\\ndelusion, totally ignorant of her own heart--and, in short, that she had\\r\\nnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was\\r\\nthe knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which\\r\\nshe reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She was most\\r\\nsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\\r\\nto her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her mind\\r\\nwas disgusting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\\r\\nbody's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\\r\\nbody's destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and\\r\\nshe had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. She had\\r\\nbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\\r\\nKnightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\\r\\nher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\\r\\nattachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\\r\\nHarriet's;--and even were this not the case, he would never have known\\r\\nHarriet at all but for her folly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every\\r\\nwonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\\r\\nbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\\r\\nsurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\\r\\nthought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her\\r\\nside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\\r\\nmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers,\\r\\nthe merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and\\r\\ndisdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could\\r\\nit be?--No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from\\r\\nimpossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities\\r\\nto be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps\\r\\ntoo busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was\\r\\nit new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,\\r\\nincongruous--or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct\\r\\nthe human fate?\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\\r\\nought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not, with a\\r\\nfolly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\\r\\nunexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\\r\\nin the line of life to which she ought to belong--all would have been\\r\\nsafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to\\r\\nMr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such\\r\\na man till actually assured of it!--But Harriet was less humble, had\\r\\nfewer scruples than formerly.--Her inferiority, whether of mind or\\r\\nsituation, seemed little felt.--She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\\r\\nElton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's.--Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\\r\\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but\\r\\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\\r\\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If\\r\\nHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\\r\\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nfirst in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\\r\\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\\r\\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\\r\\nbeen.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\\r\\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\\r\\ncould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\\r\\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\\r\\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\\r\\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\\r\\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would\\r\\nnot acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\\r\\nfrom family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he\\r\\nhad loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to\\r\\nimprove her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature\\r\\nhad at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear\\r\\nto him; might she not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,\\r\\nhowever, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not\\r\\npresume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy\\r\\nof being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.\\r\\n_She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of\\r\\nblindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very recent\\r\\nproof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he been by her behaviour to\\r\\nMiss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her\\r\\non the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too\\r\\nstrongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and\\r\\nclear-sighted goodwill.--She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name\\r\\nof hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was\\r\\nnow in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at\\r\\ntimes much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be\\r\\noverrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the\\r\\nconsequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.\\r\\nCould she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she\\r\\nbelieved she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the\\r\\nsame Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to\\r\\nall the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious\\r\\nintercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be\\r\\nfully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be\\r\\nincompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt\\r\\nfor him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not\\r\\nmarry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\\r\\nhoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least\\r\\nbe able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them\\r\\nhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\\r\\nhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how\\r\\nto admit that she could be blinded here.--He was expected back every\\r\\nday. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it\\r\\nappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\\r\\nresolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,\\r\\nit would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She was\\r\\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\\r\\nno authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to\\r\\nirritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg\\r\\nthat she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to\\r\\nbe her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\\r\\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed\\r\\nto pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she\\r\\nobjected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they\\r\\nhad forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and\\r\\napproved, and was grateful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's\\r\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\\r\\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\\r\\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\\r\\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\\r\\nrelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his\\r\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\\r\\ninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\\r\\nmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter\\r\\nof an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of\\r\\nawkward feelings, could have afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\\r\\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\\r\\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all\\r\\nat present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and\\r\\nto defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.\\r\\nChurchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,\\r\\nconsidering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\\r\\nwithout leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\\r\\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\\r\\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\\r\\nor if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuch things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways got about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\\r\\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very\\r\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\\r\\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\\r\\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\\r\\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\\r\\ndaughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\\r\\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\\r\\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\\r\\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\\r\\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\\r\\nFairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\\r\\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\\r\\non being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,\\r\\nMrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\\r\\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\\r\\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,\\r\\nand the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling\\r\\ntowards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but\\r\\nwhen these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the\\r\\npresent and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was\\r\\nconvinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her\\r\\ncompanion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,\\r\\nand was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\\r\\nmany months,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Weston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe was energetic. This was one\\r\\nof her expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into the\\r\\nengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have\\r\\nnever known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip,\\r\\nEmma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor girl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe thinks herself wrong, then, for having\\r\\nconsented to a private engagement?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\\r\\nto blame herself. 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of\\r\\nperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment\\r\\nthat misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no\\r\\nexpiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all\\r\\nmy sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,\\r\\nand the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me\\r\\nought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was\\r\\ntaught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the\\r\\ncare of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;\\r\\nand I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances\\r\\nmay appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel\\r\\nCampbell.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor girl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe loves him then excessively, I\\r\\nsuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be\\r\\nled to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\\r\\njudgment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Emma, sighing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I must often have\\r\\ncontributed to make her unhappy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she\\r\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\\r\\nmisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\\r\\nconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas\\r\\nthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\\r\\namiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\\r\\nand irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for\\r\\nhim to bear. 'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought\\r\\nto have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, and\\r\\nthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\\r\\ncircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\\r\\nme, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the\\r\\ngreat kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\\r\\nwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had\\r\\nan opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every\\r\\nwish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had\\r\\nnever received any proper acknowledgment from herself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I did not know her to be happy now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, seriously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich,\\r\\nin spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\\r\\nmust be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\\r\\nwere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\\r\\nFairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this\\r\\nis all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\\r\\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\\r\\nvery good--I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\\r\\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\\r\\nwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him\\r\\nvery much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a\\r\\ngreat deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she had too much\\r\\nto urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or\\r\\nto Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended\\r\\nwith, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,\\r\\nbut I hope it will soon come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she was obliged to pause before she\\r\\nanswered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at\\r\\nall recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you well, my Emma?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Mrs. Weston's parting question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\\r\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for\\r\\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\\r\\nsense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\\r\\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\\r\\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\\r\\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention\\r\\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\\r\\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured\\r\\nto find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\\r\\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\\r\\nnow.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\\r\\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other--what\\r\\nwas she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\\r\\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this\\r\\nimportant matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her as\\r\\nshe ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\\r\\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\\r\\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\\r\\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\\r\\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the\\r\\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil\\r\\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\\r\\nthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\\r\\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\\r\\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on\\r\\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\\r\\nThe weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and\\r\\nnothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was\\r\\ndespoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights\\r\\nthe longer visible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\\r\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by\\r\\nexertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\\r\\nher of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's\\r\\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,\\r\\nand dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\\r\\nHartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\\r\\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\\r\\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\\r\\nno pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared\\r\\nwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\\r\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that\\r\\nmight not be even partially brightened. If all took place that\\r\\nmight take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\\r\\ncomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\\r\\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\\r\\nherself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.\\r\\nThey should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\\r\\nalso.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\\r\\nFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\\r\\nHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.\\r\\nAll that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the\\r\\nloss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or\\r\\nof rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer\\r\\ncoming there for his evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all\\r\\nhours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was\\r\\nit to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake;\\r\\nif he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society\\r\\nall that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,\\r\\nthe dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best\\r\\nblessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but\\r\\nthe reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her\\r\\nown work?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\\r\\na start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a\\r\\nfew seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\\r\\nor composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\\r\\nconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\\r\\nbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\\r\\nwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\\r\\nleave her less to regret when it were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; and\\r\\nthe same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\\r\\nHartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\\r\\nsofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\\r\\nsummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma\\r\\nresolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite\\r\\nsight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after\\r\\na storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they\\r\\nmight gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after\\r\\ndinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time\\r\\nin hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and\\r\\nthoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.\\r\\nKnightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.--It\\r\\nwas the first intimation of his being returned from London. She had\\r\\nbeen thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles\\r\\ndistant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She\\r\\nmust be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow d'ye do's\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after\\r\\ntheir mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only\\r\\nthat morning. He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with\\r\\nher, she found. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was\\r\\nnot wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--She thought he neither\\r\\nlooked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,\\r\\nsuggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his\\r\\nplans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had\\r\\nbeen received.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\\r\\nat her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\\r\\ngive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\\r\\nspeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\\r\\nencouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\\r\\nway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could\\r\\nnot bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\\r\\nconsidered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\\r\\nsurprize you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he quietly, and looking at her; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof what nature?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he\\r\\nreplied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\\r\\nalready.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow is it possible?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\\r\\nhim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\\r\\nat Mrs. Goddard's in his way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\\r\\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\\r\\ncomposure,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\\r\\nhad your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\\r\\nme a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice\\r\\nand a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having\\r\\nexcited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within\\r\\nhis, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone\\r\\nof great sensibility, speaking low,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTime, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent\\r\\nsense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow\\r\\nyourself--.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more\\r\\nbroken and subdued accent, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe feelings of the warmest\\r\\nfriendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--And in a louder,\\r\\nsteadier tone, he concluded with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe will soon be gone. They will soon\\r\\nbe in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\\r\\nof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\\r\\nI am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was\\r\\ngoing on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed\\r\\nof, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\\r\\nwell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\\r\\nto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, looking eagerly at her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care you, indeed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--but\\r\\nchecking himself--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased\\r\\nthat you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! and\\r\\nit will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\\r\\nof more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not\\r\\nfarther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\\r\\nmyself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that\\r\\nthere was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him to\\r\\ndeserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded\\r\\nwith that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\\r\\ncreature.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Knightley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\\r\\nerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\\r\\nhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\\r\\nat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural\\r\\nfor a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never\\r\\nhave.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\\r\\nnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\\r\\nclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in\\r\\nhis opinion. She went on, however.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his\\r\\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,\\r\\nprobably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\\r\\nsex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\\r\\nas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\\r\\nHe was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I always found\\r\\nhim very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\\r\\ncauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity\\r\\nwas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however--for some\\r\\ntime, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought\\r\\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\\r\\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\\r\\nattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\\r\\nnever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\\r\\nsituation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him; and\\r\\nno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except\\r\\nthat I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I\\r\\nwas somehow or other safe from him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\\r\\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she\\r\\ncould judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone,\\r\\nhe said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\\r\\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\\r\\nbeen but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\\r\\nmay yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no\\r\\nmotive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will be\\r\\ninvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\\r\\nwell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt of their being happy together,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe\\r\\nthem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a most fortunate man!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo\\r\\nearly in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a\\r\\nwife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\\r\\na prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,\\r\\nhas before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested\\r\\nlove, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;\\r\\nevery thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as\\r\\nregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;\\r\\nequality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her\\r\\nheart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it\\r\\nwill be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always\\r\\nwish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;\\r\\nand he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must,\\r\\nI think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the\\r\\nfavourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets\\r\\nwith a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even\\r\\nweary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought\\r\\nround the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\\r\\nher superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to\\r\\nspeak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--He had used\\r\\nevery body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--He is a\\r\\nfortunate man indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou speak as if you envied him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence\\r\\nof Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\\r\\npossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\\r\\ndifferent--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\\r\\nbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I\\r\\nsee, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,\\r\\nI must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\\r\\nnext moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she eagerly cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake a\\r\\nlittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\\r\\nanother syllable followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\\r\\nher--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\\r\\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\\r\\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,\\r\\nrelieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more\\r\\nintolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had\\r\\nreached the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are going in, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which\\r\\nhe still spoke--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\\r\\ngone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI stopped you\\r\\nungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\\r\\npain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or\\r\\nto ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as\\r\\na friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. I\\r\\nwill tell you exactly what I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a friend!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma, that I fear is a\\r\\nword--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I\\r\\nhave gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your\\r\\noffer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to\\r\\nyou as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\\r\\nof his eyes overpowered her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Emma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor dearest you will always be, whatever\\r\\nthe event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved\\r\\nEmma--tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--She could\\r\\nreally say nothing.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are silent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, with great animation;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\\r\\ndread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\\r\\nprominent feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot make speeches, Emma:\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he soon resumed; and in a tone of\\r\\nsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\\r\\nconvincing.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\\r\\nmore. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I\\r\\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\\r\\nwoman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would\\r\\ntell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The\\r\\nmanner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have\\r\\nbeen a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,\\r\\nyou understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,\\r\\nI ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\\r\\nvelocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to\\r\\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's\\r\\nhopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a\\r\\ndelusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was every\\r\\nthing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet\\r\\nhad been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her\\r\\nagitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all\\r\\nreceived as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time\\r\\nfor these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there\\r\\nwas time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and\\r\\nto resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service\\r\\nshe could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of\\r\\nsentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his\\r\\naffection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the\\r\\ntwo--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at\\r\\nonce and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not\\r\\nmarry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and\\r\\nwith contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that\\r\\ncould be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her\\r\\nfriend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her\\r\\njudgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever\\r\\nbeen before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal\\r\\nand degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spoke\\r\\nthen, on being so entreated.--What did she say?--Just what she ought,\\r\\nof course. A lady always does.--She said enough to shew there need not\\r\\nbe despair--and to invite him to say more himself. He _had_ despaired at\\r\\none period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence,\\r\\nas for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear\\r\\nhim.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of\\r\\ntaking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had\\r\\njust put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its\\r\\ninconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,\\r\\nand seek no farther explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\\r\\nseldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a\\r\\nlittle mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is\\r\\nmistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.\\r\\nKnightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she\\r\\npossessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\\r\\nfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\\r\\nin his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no\\r\\nselfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an\\r\\nopening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of\\r\\nthe moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The\\r\\ndelightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill,\\r\\nof her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth\\r\\nto the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--but\\r\\nit had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest of\\r\\neagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his\\r\\nattempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were\\r\\nso much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he had been asking\\r\\nto be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within half\\r\\nan hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to\\r\\nsomething so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same\\r\\nprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\\r\\ndegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had been\\r\\na long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\\r\\nof Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\\r\\nChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\\r\\nenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\\r\\nthat had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided\\r\\nhim on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again\\r\\nsuch permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be\\r\\nindifferent.--But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\\r\\ndomestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form\\r\\nin it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\\r\\ninferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before\\r\\nhim, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\\r\\nstayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's\\r\\npost had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness\\r\\nwhich must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never\\r\\nbelieved Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much\\r\\nfond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no\\r\\nlonger. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly\\r\\nafter dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,\\r\\nfaultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\\r\\nHe heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill's\\r\\ncharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\\r\\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank\\r\\nChurchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\\r\\nwhat she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope for\\r\\na little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter of\\r\\nhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\\r\\ngreater when the flutter should have passed away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how often\\r\\nit had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\\r\\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\\r\\nwestern sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\\r\\nlike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\\r\\nusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the\\r\\nbreast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously\\r\\nhoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he have seen the\\r\\nheart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the\\r\\nmost distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest\\r\\nperception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,\\r\\nhe repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had\\r\\nreceived from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,\\r\\ntotally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;\\r\\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\\r\\nsubdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax\\r\\nfor such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points\\r\\nto consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\\r\\nalloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\\r\\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\\r\\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father,\\r\\nit was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\\r\\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\\r\\nsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over\\r\\nthe idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\\r\\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\\r\\ndrawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--How\\r\\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare\\r\\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\\r\\nhow to appear least her enemy?--On these subjects, her perplexity\\r\\nand distress were very great--and her mind had to pass again and\\r\\nagain through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\\r\\nsurrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would still\\r\\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\\r\\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\\r\\njust now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme\\r\\nmore--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\r\\nfor her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\\r\\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--She did\\r\\nnot think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty\\r\\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate,\\r\\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\\r\\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\\r\\nevil day, when they must all be together again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\\r\\nleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\\r\\nup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\\r\\nan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\\r\\nliterally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\\r\\nproper share of the happiness of the evening before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\\r\\nslightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\\r\\nbrought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed what it\\r\\nmust contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She was now\\r\\nin perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\\r\\nwanted only to have her thoughts to herself--and as for understanding\\r\\nany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be\\r\\nwaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a\\r\\nnote from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\\r\\nMrs. Weston.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\\r\\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely\\r\\na doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree\\r\\nabout the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We\\r\\nare quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the little\\r\\nnervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks\\r\\non Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never\\r\\nown being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east\\r\\nwind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday\\r\\nafternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last\\r\\nnight, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYours ever,\\r\\n                                                       \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA. W.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n                       [To Mrs. Weston.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.\\r\\nMY DEAR MADAM,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be\\r\\nexpected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\\r\\nindulgence.--You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\\r\\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--But\\r\\nI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\\r\\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\\r\\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\\r\\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\\r\\nand of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You\\r\\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I\\r\\nfirst arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which\\r\\nwas to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place\\r\\nmyself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.\\r\\nI shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it a right,\\r\\nI refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and\\r\\ncasements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\\r\\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\\r\\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\\r\\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\\r\\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she refused, I\\r\\nshould have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your\\r\\nhope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--To any thing, every\\r\\nthing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\\r\\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\\r\\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her\\r\\npromises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,\\r\\nI have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and\\r\\nthe advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no\\r\\ninheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See\\r\\nme, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to\\r\\nRandalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have\\r\\nbeen sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till\\r\\nMiss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you\\r\\nwill forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by\\r\\nreminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long\\r\\nI lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very\\r\\nhappy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to\\r\\nreprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,\\r\\nthe only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which\\r\\nexcites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With\\r\\nthe greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest\\r\\nhumiliation.--A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his\\r\\nopinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\\r\\nto Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to\\r\\nassist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than\\r\\nan allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately\\r\\nthrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but\\r\\nI am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been\\r\\nconvinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any\\r\\nselfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,\\r\\nshe never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and\\r\\nthat she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,\\r\\nwas as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with\\r\\nan easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\\r\\nWe seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those\\r\\nattentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse\\r\\nbegan really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,\\r\\nI cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was\\r\\nwithin a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not\\r\\nwithout suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,\\r\\nat least in some degree.--She may not have surmised the whole, but her\\r\\nquickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,\\r\\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it\\r\\ndid not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.\\r\\nI remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude\\r\\nfor her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct\\r\\ntowards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation\\r\\nof what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against\\r\\nEmma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\\r\\nprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes\\r\\nof that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\\r\\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\\r\\nmyself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\\r\\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\\r\\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\\r\\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Of\\r\\nthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\\r\\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never\\r\\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--The\\r\\ndelicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,\\r\\nis much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly\\r\\nhope, know her thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her.\\r\\nShe must tell you herself what she is--yet not by word, for never\\r\\nwas there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own\\r\\nmerit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,\\r\\nI have heard from her.--She gives a good account of her own health; but\\r\\nas she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion\\r\\nof her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread\\r\\nof the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without\\r\\ndelay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few\\r\\nminutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and\\r\\nI am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or\\r\\nmisery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her\\r\\nexcellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:\\r\\nbut when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little\\r\\nI deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her\\r\\nagain!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me\\r\\nto encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard\\r\\nall that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\\r\\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\\r\\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event\\r\\nof the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the\\r\\nhappiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,\\r\\nbut from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to\\r\\nlose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she\\r\\nwould have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and\\r\\nrefinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered\\r\\ninto with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off\\r\\nabruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over\\r\\nthe country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of\\r\\nmy letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying\\r\\nretrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that\\r\\nmy manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly\\r\\nblameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My\\r\\nplea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was\\r\\ndispleased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand\\r\\noccasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even\\r\\ncold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and\\r\\nsubdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\\r\\nescaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\\r\\nDo you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\\r\\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;\\r\\nI met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she\\r\\nwould not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then\\r\\nthought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very\\r\\nnatural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the\\r\\nworld to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\\r\\nparticularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a\\r\\nproposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we\\r\\nbeen met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must\\r\\nhave been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted\\r\\nher affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,\\r\\nprovoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect\\r\\nof her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\\r\\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in\\r\\na form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear\\r\\nmadam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and\\r\\nI returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with\\r\\nyou till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with\\r\\nher as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to\\r\\nbe reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her\\r\\ncoldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first\\r\\nadvances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of\\r\\nthe Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly\\r\\nsuppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon\\r\\nher appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she\\r\\nfound I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\\r\\nofficious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the\\r\\nbye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel\\r\\nwith a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards\\r\\nmyself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it\\r\\nwhich that woman has known.--'Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I\\r\\nhave not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.\\r\\nThink, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between\\r\\nthe Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the\\r\\ninsolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon\\r\\nhave done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me\\r\\nentirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet\\r\\nagain.--_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_\\r\\n_repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This\\r\\nletter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I\\r\\nanswered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the\\r\\nmultiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of\\r\\nbeing sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in\\r\\nmy writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but\\r\\na few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was\\r\\nrather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I\\r\\nmade excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful\\r\\nin my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two\\r\\ndays afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all\\r\\nreturned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her\\r\\nextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and\\r\\nadding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,\\r\\nand as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate\\r\\narrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe\\r\\nconveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly\\r\\ncommand hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would\\r\\nforward them after that period to her at--: in short, the full direction\\r\\nto Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the\\r\\nname, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had\\r\\nbeen doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\\r\\nwhich I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to\\r\\nany such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its\\r\\nanxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten\\r\\nme.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my\\r\\nown blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be\\r\\ndone?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I\\r\\ncould not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were\\r\\nin my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,\\r\\nearlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;\\r\\nand could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I\\r\\nmight find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I\\r\\nfelt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity\\r\\nme for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my\\r\\nsuspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached\\r\\nHighbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her\\r\\nwan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\\r\\nknowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\\r\\nof finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was not\\r\\ndisappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of very\\r\\nreasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is\\r\\ndone; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's\\r\\nuneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will\\r\\nrelease you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousand\\r\\nthanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for\\r\\nthe attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in\\r\\na way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss\\r\\nW. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.--In one\\r\\nrespect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe\\r\\nmyself,\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, in\\r\\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\\r\\njustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\\r\\nit was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\\r\\nand almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject\\r\\ncould still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard\\r\\nfor the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of\\r\\nlove must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gone\\r\\nthrough the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had\\r\\nbeen wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had\\r\\nsuffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and\\r\\nso much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that\\r\\nthere was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must\\r\\nhave shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\\r\\nshe desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to\\r\\nbe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so\\r\\nmuch to blame in his conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be very glad to look it over,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it seems long. I\\r\\nwill take it home with me at night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\\r\\nmust return it by him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would rather be talking to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut as it seems a\\r\\nmatter of justice, it shall be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad I been offered\\r\\nthe sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few\\r\\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\\r\\nsmile, observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHumph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\\r\\nway. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be\\r\\nsevere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be natural for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added shortly afterwards, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto speak my\\r\\nopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\\r\\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all. I should wish it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe trifles here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,\\r\\nand has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the\\r\\nengagement.--'His father's disposition:'--he is unjust, however, to his\\r\\nfather. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright\\r\\nand honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort\\r\\nbefore he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss\\r\\nFairfax was here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I have not forgotten,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow sure you were that he might\\r\\nhave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you\\r\\nwere perfectly right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had\\r\\n_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\\r\\naloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\\r\\nhead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\\r\\nthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\\r\\nreflection, thus--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous\\r\\ngame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--No judge of\\r\\nhis own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\\r\\nregardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to have\\r\\nfathomed his secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue,\\r\\nthat he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert\\r\\nthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\\r\\nand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each\\r\\nother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,\\r\\nwhich she could not give any sincere explanation of.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better go on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe pianoforte! Ah! That\\r\\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether\\r\\nthe inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A\\r\\nboyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a\\r\\nwoman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense\\r\\nwith; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's\\r\\ncoming if she could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's\\r\\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\\r\\nmore than a word in passing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI perfectly agree with you, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--was then his remark. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou did behave\\r\\nvery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And having gone through\\r\\nwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\\r\\npersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right,\\r\\nhe made a fuller pause to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is very bad.--He had induced her\\r\\nto place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and\\r\\nuneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from\\r\\nsuffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend\\r\\nwith, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have\\r\\nrespected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were\\r\\nall reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she\\r\\nhad done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she\\r\\nshould have been in such a state of punishment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\\r\\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\\r\\ndeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\\r\\nhowever, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\\r\\nexcepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\\r\\nof giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\\r\\nEltons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his next observation.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis feelings are natural.--What!\\r\\nactually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to\\r\\nbe a source of repentance and misery to each--she dissolved it.--What a\\r\\nview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most\\r\\nextraordinary--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope he does,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c'Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a\\r\\ndear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\\r\\nbye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of\\r\\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\\r\\nthe man writes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in\\r\\nfinding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\\r\\nher. 'Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue to\\r\\nfeel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal\\r\\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--'Happier than I\\r\\ndeserve.' Come, he knows himself there. 'Miss Woodhouse calls me the\\r\\nchild of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--\\r\\nAnd a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\\r\\nThat was your name for him, was it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\\r\\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\\r\\nhope it does him some service with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\\r\\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\\r\\nin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\\r\\nis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\\r\\nmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very\\r\\nready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the\\r\\nsteadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk\\r\\nto you of something else. I have another person's interest at present\\r\\nso much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.\\r\\nEver since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work\\r\\non one subject.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\\r\\nEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\\r\\nwith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\\r\\nhappiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\\r\\nfor her. She could never quit him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Part only of this answer, however,\\r\\nwas admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any\\r\\nother change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most\\r\\ndeeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to\\r\\nremove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but\\r\\nhis knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself\\r\\nlong; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation\\r\\nwould be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which\\r\\nmust not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt\\r\\nthat it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the\\r\\nsacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any\\r\\nrespect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield;\\r\\nthat so long as her father's happiness--in other words, his life--required\\r\\nHartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\\r\\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\\r\\nan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\\r\\nthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\\r\\nbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\\r\\nin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\\r\\nwould be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it,\\r\\nand advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no\\r\\nreflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had\\r\\ngiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had\\r\\nbeen walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his\\r\\nthoughts to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure\\r\\nWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\\r\\nask mine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\\r\\nmoreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\\r\\nscheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\\r\\nwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\\r\\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\\r\\nheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must\\r\\nof the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only\\r\\ngave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in\\r\\ndetecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's\\r\\nmarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\\r\\nwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\\r\\nHartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\\r\\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual\\r\\ngood to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the\\r\\nperiods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--Such a partner in\\r\\nall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\\r\\nmelancholy!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\\r\\nof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\\r\\nwho must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\\r\\nparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\\r\\ncharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\\r\\nevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\\r\\nfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a\\r\\ndead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\\r\\npeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of\\r\\nunmerited punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\r\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\\r\\nKnightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not\\r\\nlike Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\\r\\nconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\\r\\nthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\\r\\ncould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\\r\\nherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\\r\\nletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\\r\\nreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\\r\\nwas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style,\\r\\nwhich increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be\\r\\nonly her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have\\r\\nbeen quite without resentment under such a stroke.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was\\r\\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting\\r\\nto invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and\\r\\nhad wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\\r\\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\\r\\nher--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\\r\\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled\\r\\non her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her\\r\\nvery persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\\r\\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was\\r\\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\\r\\nSquare.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could\\r\\ntalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\\r\\nof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her\\r\\nwhen remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might\\r\\nat that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings\\r\\nwhich she had led astray herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\\r\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think\\r\\nof her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must\\r\\nbe averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\r\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before\\r\\nher, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--the confession of\\r\\nher engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it\\r\\nat present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston\\r\\nwere safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this\\r\\nperiod among those she loved--and the evil should not act on herself\\r\\nby anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of\\r\\nleisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,\\r\\ndelight, should be hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\\r\\nhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She ought\\r\\nto go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\\r\\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\\r\\n_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect\\r\\nwould certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any\\r\\nthing Jane might communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\\r\\nbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had\\r\\nbeen in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the\\r\\nworst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still\\r\\nunwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to\\r\\nwait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcing\\r\\nit; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so\\r\\nhappily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeg her to walk up;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs\\r\\nby Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her\\r\\nwere felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely,\\r\\nso engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was\\r\\nevery thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\\r\\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\\r\\nfeeling tone,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me\\r\\nto express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely\\r\\nwithout words.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\\r\\nsound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked\\r\\nher, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\\r\\ncongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\\r\\naccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\\r\\nElton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\\r\\nbody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the\\r\\nrencontre would do them no harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and\\r\\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\\r\\nMiss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was\\r\\nstill a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in\\r\\nthe expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.\\r\\nBates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw\\r\\nher with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she\\r\\nhad apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into\\r\\nthe purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\\r\\nopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I\\r\\nonly wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\\r\\nnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\\r\\ncreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not a word\\r\\nmore. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You\\r\\nremember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:\\r\\n\\r\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor when a lady's in the case,\\r\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know all other things give place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word to\\r\\nthe wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set\\r\\nyour heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has\\r\\nquite appeased her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's\\r\\nknitting, she added, in a half whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a\\r\\nminister of state. I managed it extremely well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\r\\npossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of\\r\\nthe weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\r\\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\\r\\ncredit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\\r\\nword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you had\\r\\nseen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--And when Mrs. Bates\\r\\nwas saying something to Emma, whispered farther, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe do not say a word\\r\\nof any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\\r\\nphysician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nshortly afterwards began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csince the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\\r\\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\\r\\nseem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So\\r\\nit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\\r\\nit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our\\r\\ncollecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the\\r\\nfine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite the\\r\\nsame party, not _one_ exception.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\\r\\ndiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\\r\\nshe supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\\r\\nevery thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\\r\\nto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--that\\r\\nis, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy little\\r\\ncircle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--that\\r\\nis--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to\\r\\nJane!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight\\r\\ntowards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a\\r\\nlittle show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter,\\r\\nwhich was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, which\\r\\nplaced it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\\r\\nanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\\r\\nis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\\r\\nhere, and pay his respects to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That will\\r\\nbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and\\r\\nMr. Elton's time is so engaged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to\\r\\nnight.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence or\\r\\nother.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\\r\\nwanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\\r\\nhim.--'Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, 'rather you than I.--I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had\\r\\nhalf so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect\\r\\nthem both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar\\r\\nthis fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on\\r\\npurpose to wait on you all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And putting up her hand to screen her\\r\\nwords from Emma--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quite\\r\\nindispensable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily--!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\\r\\nfrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\\r\\nconsultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Mr. Elton\\r\\ngone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\\r\\nCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\\r\\nlead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave not you mistaken the day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am almost certain that\\r\\nthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was at\\r\\nHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the abrupt answer, which\\r\\ndenoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do\\r\\nbelieve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is the most troublesome parish that ever\\r\\nwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour parish there was small,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\\r\\ntalked of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\\r\\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the\\r\\nonly school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you\\r\\nhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we\\r\\ncould be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce\\r\\nperfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_\\r\\npeople may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word,\\r\\nif you please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\\r\\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\\r\\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\\r\\nevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\\r\\nsparkling vivacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\r\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--But\\r\\nyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should\\r\\nnot stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sitting\\r\\nthis hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\\r\\nobedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\\r\\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\\r\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the\\r\\nwalk he had had for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I got to Donwell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnightley could not be found. Very\\r\\nodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the\\r\\nmessage he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDonwell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his wife.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. E., you have not been to\\r\\nDonwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\\r\\nto-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I went\\r\\nover the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\\r\\nit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you\\r\\nI am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\\r\\nhousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Very\\r\\nextraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps\\r\\nto Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\\r\\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\\r\\nought to do,) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\\r\\nall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\\r\\nbe forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\\r\\nsure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and his\\r\\nservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\\r\\nto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,\\r\\nextremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a\\r\\ncreature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And\\r\\nas for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised\\r\\nWright a receipt, and never sent it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI met William Larkins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Elton, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas I got near the house,\\r\\nand he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\\r\\nbelieve him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\\r\\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the\\r\\nspeech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really\\r\\nis of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and it\\r\\nbecomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should\\r\\nhave had this hot walk to no purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In\\r\\nall probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\\r\\nKnightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\\r\\nMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\\r\\nattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\\r\\nan opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\\r\\nnot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\\r\\nintroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\\r\\nhave been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been\\r\\nimpertinent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\\r\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\\r\\ncomposure--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere would have been no danger. The danger would have\\r\\nbeen of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than\\r\\nby expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\\r\\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\\r\\ngreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\\r\\nof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\\r\\ndisgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could\\r\\nwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\\r\\nmyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your\\r\\ncompassion does not stand my friend--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma warmly, and\\r\\ntaking her hand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\\r\\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\\r\\neven--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--So\\r\\ncold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of\\r\\ndeceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\\r\\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\\r\\nquickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\\r\\nhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--just as\\r\\nI begin to know you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\\r\\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma,\\r\\nsmiling--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut, excuse me, it must be thought of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\\r\\nam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\\r\\nat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\\r\\ndeep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\\r\\nmore to wait for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured\\r\\nof.--Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\\r\\nopen!--Good-bye, good-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\\r\\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\\r\\nknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\\r\\nwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\\r\\nany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's\\r\\nsons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father\\r\\nand mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew\\r\\nolder--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to\\r\\nhave his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\\r\\nand the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--no\\r\\none could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be\\r\\nquite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have\\r\\ntheir powers in exercise again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\ncontinued--\\xe2\\x80\\x9clike La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame\\r\\nde Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\\r\\nAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Knightley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe will indulge her even more than\\r\\nshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\\r\\nbe the only difference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor child!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat that rate, what will become of her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable\\r\\nin infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\\r\\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all\\r\\nmy happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be\\r\\nsevere on them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma laughed, and replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I had the assistance of all your\\r\\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether\\r\\nmy own sense would have corrected me without it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylor\\r\\ngave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\\r\\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\\r\\nright has he to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural for you to\\r\\nfeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\\r\\nyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the\\r\\ntenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without\\r\\ndoating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\\r\\nhave been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure you were of use to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very often\\r\\ninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I\\r\\nam very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\\r\\nspoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\\r\\nas you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\\r\\nthirteen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\\r\\nsaucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\\r\\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I\\r\\ndid not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\\r\\nfeelings instead of one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches\\r\\nin such affectionate remembrance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c'Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from\\r\\nhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I want\\r\\nyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about\\r\\nten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\\r\\nyou made no objection, I never did it again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd cannot you call me 'George' now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpossible!--I never can call you any thing but 'Mr. Knightley.' I\\r\\nwill not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\\r\\ncalling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added presently, laughing\\r\\nand blushing--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will promise to call you once by your Christian name.\\r\\nI do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in\\r\\nwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\\r\\nservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the\\r\\nadvice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\\r\\nfollies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\\r\\nsubject.--She could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned\\r\\nbetween them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being\\r\\nthought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,\\r\\nand a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were\\r\\ndeclining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\\r\\ncircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\\r\\nher intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\\r\\nIsabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\\r\\nobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to\\r\\nthe pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\\r\\nexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which\\r\\nappeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,\\r\\nsince that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet\\r\\ndifferent from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure,\\r\\nwas no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing\\r\\nwith the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and\\r\\nhopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;\\r\\nher fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John\\r\\nKnightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain\\r\\ntill they could bring her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn does not even mention your friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Knightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is\\r\\nhis answer, if you like to see it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\\r\\naccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know\\r\\nwhat he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her\\r\\nfriend was unmentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn enters like a brother into my happiness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Knightley,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\\r\\nlikewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making\\r\\nflourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in\\r\\nher praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe writes like a sensible man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma, when she had read the\\r\\nletter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\\r\\ngood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\\r\\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\\r\\nyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\\r\\nconstruction, I should not have believed him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmuch less, perhaps, than\\r\\nhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\\r\\nsubject.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma, my dear Emma--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried with more thorough gaiety, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you fancy your brother\\r\\ndoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\\r\\nand hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing\\r\\n_you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on\\r\\nyour side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not\\r\\nsink into 'poor Emma' with him at once.--His tender compassion towards\\r\\noppressed worth can go no farther.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish your father might be half as easily convinced as\\r\\nJohn will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be\\r\\nhappy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter--did you notice\\r\\nit?--where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by\\r\\nsurprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the\\r\\nkind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\\r\\nsome thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\\r\\nunprepared for that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\\r\\nfeelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any\\r\\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at\\r\\nthis time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, I\\r\\nsuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\\r\\nthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\\r\\nas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle seems\\r\\nalways tired now.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\\r\\npersons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\\r\\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that\\r\\nher gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to\\r\\nannounce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her\\r\\nfather at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.\\r\\nKnightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have\\r\\nfailed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come\\r\\nat such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was\\r\\nforced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a\\r\\nmore decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\\r\\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she\\r\\ncould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\\r\\nin a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\\r\\nobtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\\r\\nsince it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she and Mr.\\r\\nKnightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\\r\\nconstant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, next\\r\\nto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\\r\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\\r\\nhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\\r\\na great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,\\r\\nand poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about him\\r\\naffectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must\\r\\nnot class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them\\r\\nfrom Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not\\r\\ngoing from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing\\r\\nno change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she\\r\\nwas very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr.\\r\\nKnightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.--Did\\r\\nhe not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He would not deny that he did,\\r\\nshe was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.\\r\\nKnightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters,\\r\\nwho so glad to assist him?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached\\r\\nto him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes. That\\r\\nwas all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should\\r\\nbe glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it\\r\\nwas.--Why could not they go on as they had done?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\\r\\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--To\\r\\nEmma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond\\r\\npraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\\r\\nused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all\\r\\nthe assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\\r\\napprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\\r\\nconsider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled,\\r\\nand, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importance\\r\\nof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed\\r\\nupon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be\\r\\nguided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\\r\\nfeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\\r\\ntime or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very\\r\\nbad if the marriage did take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\\r\\nsaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\\r\\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\\r\\nsaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\\r\\nurging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\\r\\nto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\\r\\nso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\\r\\nrespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\\r\\nso singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\\r\\nhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\\r\\nbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\\r\\nlong ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\\r\\nwould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\\r\\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such\\r\\nan arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for\\r\\na marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\\r\\nand Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.\\r\\nWeston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish\\r\\nthe subject better than by saying--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose matters will take care of\\r\\nthemselves; the young people will find a way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But here there was\\r\\nnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\\r\\nall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\\r\\nIt was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without\\r\\none real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\\r\\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could\\r\\nincrease her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have\\r\\noutgrown its first set of caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\\r\\nhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\\r\\nfamiliarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--He saw the advantages\\r\\nof the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;\\r\\nbut the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\\r\\nwas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is to be a secret, I conclude,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese matters are always a\\r\\nsecret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be\\r\\ntold when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\\r\\npoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\\r\\ndaughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,\\r\\nof course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\\r\\nafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\\r\\nhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it\\r\\nwould be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening\\r\\nwonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and\\r\\nothers might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their\\r\\nall removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;\\r\\nand another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,\\r\\nupon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one\\r\\nhabitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any\\r\\nsatisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;\\r\\nhe only hoped \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe young lady's pride would now be contented;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nsupposed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and,\\r\\non the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather\\r\\nhe than I!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor\\r\\nKnightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--She was extremely\\r\\nconcerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\\r\\nqualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in\\r\\nlove--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\\r\\npleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\\r\\nwith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poor\\r\\nfellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh!\\r\\nno; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\\r\\nthing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that\\r\\nshe had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living\\r\\ntogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who\\r\\nhad tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\\r\\nquarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\\r\\nbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\\r\\nmorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when\\r\\nMr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the\\r\\nfirst chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began\\r\\nwith,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood or bad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know which it ought to be called.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\\r\\nto smile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, composing his features, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very much afraid,\\r\\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\\r\\nor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is one subject,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope but one, on which we do not\\r\\nthink alike.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\\r\\nher face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet\\r\\nSmith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though\\r\\nshe knew not what.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you heard from her yourself this morning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have, I\\r\\nbelieve, and know the whole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet\\r\\nSmith marries Robert Martin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes,\\r\\nin eager gaze, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, this is impossible!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but her lips were closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is so, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Knightley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have it from Robert\\r\\nMartin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\\r\\nthe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\\r\\nor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not\\r\\ntalk much on the subject.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mistake me, you quite mistake me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, exerting herself.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\\r\\ncannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,\\r\\nthat Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\\r\\nhas even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that he intends it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean that he has done it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\\r\\ndetermined decision, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand been accepted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\\r\\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\\r\\nfeelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\\r\\nexpressing, she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, now tell me every thing; make this\\r\\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was\\r\\nmore surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how\\r\\nhas it been possible?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\\r\\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\\r\\nto John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\\r\\nasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were\\r\\ngoing to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our\\r\\nbrother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could\\r\\nnot resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused;\\r\\nand my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which he\\r\\ndid--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\\r\\nopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak\\r\\nin vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\\r\\ndeserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this\\r\\nmorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\\r\\non my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\\r\\nthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much\\r\\nlonger history when you see her.--She will give you all the minute\\r\\nparticulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our\\r\\ncommunications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that\\r\\nRobert Martin's heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;\\r\\nand that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that\\r\\non quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John\\r\\nKnightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\\r\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\\r\\nrather uneasy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\\r\\nwas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\\r\\nShe must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed\\r\\nhim; and after observing her a little while, he added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\\r\\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\\r\\nsituation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your\\r\\nfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him\\r\\nas you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\\r\\nyou.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend\\r\\nin better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\\r\\nsaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William\\r\\nLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\\r\\nto smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\\r\\nHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\\r\\n_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\\r\\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\\r\\ncannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared\\r\\nI was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined\\r\\nagainst him, much more, than she was before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou ought to know your friend best,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Knightley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\nshould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\\r\\nvery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I believe\\r\\nyou know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you\\r\\nperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.\\r\\nI could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--Did not you\\r\\nmisunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,\\r\\nshows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of\\r\\nso many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that he was\\r\\ncertain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert\\r\\nMartin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong\\r\\nwas the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's\\r\\nside, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that she was\\r\\nreally expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.\\r\\nIt could not be otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you dare say this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Knightley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you dare to suppose me\\r\\nso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do\\r\\nyou deserve?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\\r\\nany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\\r\\nyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\\r\\nHarriet now are?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am quite sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, speaking very distinctly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he\\r\\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\\r\\ndoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\\r\\nit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\\r\\nof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\\r\\nher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,\\r\\nthan to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he\\r\\nsaid, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly satisfied,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand most sincerely wish them happy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\r\\nHarriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for\\r\\nRobert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much\\r\\nin love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often\\r\\ntalked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,\\r\\nindeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor\\r\\nMartin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,\\r\\nI am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good\\r\\nnotions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in\\r\\nthe affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no\\r\\ndoubt, she may thank you for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, shaking her head.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! poor Harriet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\\r\\npraise than she deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\\r\\nfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\\r\\nstate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\\r\\ncollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she\\r\\nhad moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she\\r\\ncould be fit for nothing rational.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the\\r\\nhorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\\r\\nhad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\\r\\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\\r\\nHarriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\\r\\nsecurity.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\\r\\nhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.\\r\\nNothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility\\r\\nand circumspection in future.\\r\\n\\r\\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\\r\\nresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\\r\\nvery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\\r\\ndoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a\\r\\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\\r\\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\\r\\nsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\\r\\npractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\\r\\nthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to\\r\\nwelcome as a duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\\r\\nalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\\r\\nspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his\\r\\nbeing obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly\\r\\nhad they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks\\r\\nfor coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\\r\\nblind, of two figures passing near the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was just going to\\r\\ntell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He\\r\\nstays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the\\r\\nday with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to\\r\\nsee him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing\\r\\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\\r\\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\\r\\nsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that\\r\\nEmma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long\\r\\nfelt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane,\\r\\nwould yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the\\r\\nparty, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a\\r\\nwant of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank\\r\\nChurchill to draw near her and say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\\r\\nin one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less\\r\\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Emma, most happy to begin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot in the least. I am\\r\\nparticularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy\\r\\nin person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with\\r\\nserious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs not she looking well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\\r\\ndoat upon her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\\r\\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\\r\\nDixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can never think of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithout extreme shame.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe shame,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis all mine, or ought to be. But is it\\r\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you\\r\\nhad none.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never had the smallest, I assure you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I\\r\\nhad--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong\\r\\nthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\\r\\nservice.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken\\r\\nthe bond of secrecy and told you every thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not now worth a regret,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have some hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d resumed he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof my uncle's being persuaded to pay a\\r\\nvisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\\r\\nare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,\\r\\ntill we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from\\r\\nher--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not\\r\\nonce met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\\r\\nthought, he cried,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! by the bye,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\\r\\nmoment--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope Mr. Knightley is well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He paused.--She coloured and\\r\\nlaughed.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\\r\\nin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that\\r\\nI have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is\\r\\na man whom I cannot presume to praise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\\r\\nhis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\\r\\nand his next words were,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and\\r\\nyet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is a\\r\\nmost uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a most\\r\\ndistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour\\r\\nenough for beauty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have always admired her complexion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma, archly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\ndo not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\\r\\npale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help\\r\\nsaying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\\r\\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am\\r\\nsure it was a consolation to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\\r\\nmiserable wretch!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a\\r\\nsource of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\\r\\nall in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\\r\\ntruth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\\r\\nsituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf not in our dispositions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she presently added, with a look of true\\r\\nsensibility, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids\\r\\nfair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue, true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, warmly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not true on your side. You can\\r\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Look\\r\\nat her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\\r\\nthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--You will\\r\\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\\r\\nuncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set.\\r\\nI am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\\r\\nbeautiful in her dark hair?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery beautiful, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he\\r\\ngratefully burst out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\\r\\nlooks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\\r\\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\\r\\nof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\\r\\ninfant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\\r\\nbut it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending\\r\\nfor Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been\\r\\nalmost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had\\r\\nbeen perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly\\r\\ninteresting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for\\r\\nthinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done\\r\\nit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the\\r\\nslightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be\\r\\ntoo soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,\\r\\nthat he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\\r\\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had\\r\\nseen it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerry!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\r\\nFairfax's eye. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\\r\\nPerry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has\\r\\nhe set up his carriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\\r\\nlaugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really\\r\\nhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch an extraordinary dream of mine!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can never think of\\r\\nit without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\\r\\nit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\\r\\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\\r\\nwhich sent me the report, is passing under her eye--that the whole\\r\\nblunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothing else,\\r\\nthough pretending to listen to the others?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\\r\\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\\r\\nsteady voice,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They\\r\\n_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\\r\\nEmma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\\r\\nRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\\r\\nfelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\\r\\nregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\\r\\nsensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness\\r\\nof this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated\\r\\ncontemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\\r\\nmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\\r\\nunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\\r\\nrecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\\r\\nfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\\r\\nalone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable\\r\\nas it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\r\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\\r\\nself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\\r\\nthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\\r\\nfullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's\\r\\napprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\\r\\nmeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was\\r\\nmost happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the\\r\\ndinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\\r\\nBut what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now\\r\\nacknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\\r\\ncontinuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever\\r\\nbe unintelligible to Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\\r\\nreason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She proved\\r\\nto be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\\r\\ncomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\\r\\nhave always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility\\r\\nwhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to\\r\\nbe as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what\\r\\na connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the\\r\\nChurchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,\\r\\nunbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated\\r\\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\\r\\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\\r\\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\\r\\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet's\\r\\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\\r\\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\\r\\nimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\\r\\nand who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,\\r\\nand occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\\r\\ntemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\\r\\nand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\\r\\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\\r\\nman;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\r\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The\\r\\nintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\\r\\ninto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,\\r\\nand must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\r\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\\r\\nno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\\r\\ncould impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\\r\\nbut as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\\r\\nherself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\\r\\nthe three, were the first to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\r\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\r\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\\r\\nEmma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought\\r\\nto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\\r\\nallow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\\r\\nthe plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\\r\\napproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced\\r\\nto consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\\r\\ndistant event.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\\r\\nalmost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He\\r\\nbegan to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a very\\r\\npromising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he\\r\\nwas not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's\\r\\ncourage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know\\r\\nhim fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost\\r\\nacquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when\\r\\nonce the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she\\r\\nhesitated--she could not proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\r\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\\r\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\\r\\nway.--Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\\r\\nturkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\\r\\nson-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\\r\\nnight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the\\r\\nMr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them\\r\\nprotected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must\\r\\nbe in London again by the end of the first week in November.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\r\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\\r\\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called\\r\\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\\r\\njoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\\r\\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\\r\\ndetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\\r\\ninferior to her own.--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery little white satin, very few lace veils; a\\r\\nmost pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--But,\\r\\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\\r\\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\\r\\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFINIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Emma, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EMMA ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 158-0.txt or 158-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/158/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.
